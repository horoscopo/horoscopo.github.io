{"libra": {"personal": "The position of the planets could have you doing a lot of soul searching, Aquarius. You're looking deep within to discern your true goals. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find. Increased communication and deeper understanding enhance your relationships. Many of your aims are likely to be spiritual in nature. Write them down.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "With today's astral energy at play, you may find that things in the romance department seem to be very much connected with business or career issues. There is no hurry. If it's going to get serious, it will do so at a leisurely pace. You won't have an opportunity to speed up anything. However, there really is no need to rush, as slow can be just as much fun.", "trabajo": "People are nervous and reckless. Don't get caught up in this negative energy. The more you feed the fire with your own gossip and judgments, the worse off you will be. You need to break the cycle with a confident and uplifting attitude."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Every day is a new start and new chance, Sagittarius. Don't get upset or angry over past events. Don't dwell on things you can't change. Your whole life can turn around in a day, so start every morning with a positive outlook. As you wash your face in the morning, think of it as a renewal. Clean off the debris from yesterday while welcoming the freshness of a new day.", "amor": "Although you are used to surprises, you may be stunned by the events that occur today - especially if you have been searching for that fabulous person recently.

You will find that effectiveness in the workplaces increases several fold once you put your energy into the group. Put your two cents in when you know that something could be done a better way."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and a lie. Sometimes this can be a difficult choice, especially if you're afraid you'll hurt someone's feelings. However, a lie can take far more energy than the truth. Consider what you'd want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your ethics, even of it's tough.", "amor": "If you feel that all dates are a dead-end today, and all the potentials you had lined up for tonight's extravaganza seem to be positively neolithic, then perhaps you are right. The past is currently intruding on the present, and one special person seems to have regressed from a charming enigma to a shy little thing. Don't worry - things are about to improve!", "trabajo": "You will have a significant amount of breathing space today, so take advantage of it. Assess your situation without getting caught up in the drama surrounding you. This time alone will be extremely valuable with regard to your overall efficiency."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "If you meet new people today, scorpio, be careful. Some can appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing.

If danger excites you too much, it may be time to make some changes in your life.", "amor": "Don't let your usual worries stop you from going out and having a really good time this evening.

If there's someone you've been reluctant to approach, make a move to talk to him or her.", "amor": "The current astral configuration brings a touch of lunacy into your love life, in the nicest possible way. If you are going out to a party or social gathering, then be prepared to meet up with someone who will certainly bring a smile to your lips. They may even seem a little crazy, but after recent events, you will find them to be a breath of fresh air.", "trabajo": "Getting angry with others is not going to make them work faster or more efficiently.
