In fact, your energy may be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve. If you give yourself to them completely, your nerves will be shot!", "amor": "You may have quite an intense day ahead of you in terms of meetings and social events. You're putting a lot of effort into one particular relationship that seems to be especially promising. But at this stage it may also be wise to gauge just what you are getting back. It's fine to be in love, if the feeling is mutual...", "trabajo": "Unexpected opposition will come to you in waves.

Unfortunately, you are going to get itso be prepared."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": " \nYou're feeling altruistic today, Aries. You're eager to do what you can for others. You can now put into action all those lofty visions of volunteering for a worthy cause. It's time to do some real work. You'll be astonished at how great it feels to make a direct contribution. Spending time chopping vegetables in a soup kitchen is much more satisfying than mailing a check.", "amor": "A possibility of real passion will come your way. If you are looking for romance, then you may get more than you bargained for today when you attend that fancy party. Think about all those hidden disguises, behind which someone is burning and itching to get to know you better! By the end of the evening you will have made a decision. Will it be the right one?", "trabajo": "Nothing will come easily for you today, so prepare yourself. If you have an extra sick day, today might very well be the best day to use it.

Perhaps you're afraid that if you accept this offer now, you'll miss an even better one later. Don't delay. Change is progress. Go after the things that catch your eye and draw you in. These opportunities won't last forever. Stop dreaming and start doing.", "amor": "There is a much softer and far more amenable quality in the air, especially with the current aspect at play. Under this very romantic cosmic influence, you don't need to spot a potential partner and then rush in for the kill immediately. You can amble up to them slowly and take your time working out how best to win them over to your point of view. Easy does it!", "trabajo": "Someone is likely to rub you the wrong way in a very aggressive manner. Don't let this person get the better of you. He or she may come up with wild facts to use against you. Don't be fooled. Most likely these \"facts\" are closer to fiction than truth."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "There's a spark about to ignite inside you.

It would be a great time to hold a party or just invite a few friends around for a get-together. It would also be a good time to invite some new people around.

The insight you gain through this process will help you in the long run."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Something unusual could put a smile on your face today, taurus. Look for beauty and love in the simplest things. If you can't see it, then work on adjusting your attitude. Your inner state is likely what needs to be fixed, not the world around you. If you can shift to a light, understanding mood, you'll receive the laughter and romance that are sure to brighten your day.", "amor": "You will feel encouraged to talk frankly and honestlyup to a point. On some issues you may be tempted to beat about the bush, and not make yourself completely clear.

You may feel like royalty, so feel free to dress in your most regal attire. Take an independent viewpoint when asked about running your castle. Be creative, honorable, and permissive in your rule.", "amor": "There is potential for a lot of fun and laughter, with today's planetary alignment. However, your partner could find your sense of humor a little warped, which could ruin a potentially romantic occasion. You may need to explain that it's nothing personal; it's just your unique view of life that often allows you to see the funny side, even when others seem to frown.", "trabajo": "Socializing with others in an easy-going and relaxed atmosphere will bring you the most enjoyment out of this day.

There's no reason to doubt yourself now. Feel free to strut your stuff.", "amor": "You will enjoy your social engagements today. You may come face-to-face with a person who has some awesomely strange tastes. As you would never let go of a chance to talk to a living freak, you will probably engage this person in conversation. Just don't be surprised by what happens next. Call it love, passion - whatever it is, it's hot!", "trabajo": "There seems to be a difficult conflict of interest in the workplace today. Someone's conservative tactics are slowing you down. Instead of getting yourself all worked up about this, consider slowing down your own pace. Take your time."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Today you might have the desire to look into your genealogy. The Internet has made it possible for everyone to learn about their ancestors, and now is a great time for you to do it.

Make sure you are on a path that will lead you toward this satisfying end."}, "aries": {"personal": "Career matters are probably going well for you, but you might be unsure if you want to continue along this track. You might consider other options, perhaps some you've always wanted to try but have never been in a position to do. Don't feel you have to decide now. You have plenty of time. Don't make a move until you're sure.", "amor": "The planetary configuration may bring with it the opportunity to change how you see certain aspects of your closest relationship.
