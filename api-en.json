{"libra": {"personal": "You may get frustrated today when people don't seem to act rationally. To you, Gemini, the issues may be perfectly cut and dried. Keep in mind that not everyone sees the world the way you do. There's an element of strong emotion that's likely to play into the picture, an element that you probably failed to take into account. Make note of this as you go through your day.", "amor": "The atmosphere is one of joy and bonhomie today, thanks to the planetary configuration. It would be a good plan to spend the day out with your loved one, or enjoying yourself with other friends. The atmosphere is just too good to be alone, and is a wonderful time for a party or other celebration. The music and wine may flow, but you'll find a way to cope.", "trabajo": "Explosive dialogue will escalate in your workplace and, most likely, you will be a big part of it. Keep in mind that this verbal conflict may be just the thing that is needed to clear the air for better relationships all around. Don't fear it."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "The thing you dread the most could be the very thing you need the most in your life, sagittarius. You're at a point right now when the lessons that come might be hard to swallow, but they're necessary. Don't try to resist what you know you must face. Approach things with courage instead of fear and you can conquer anything. Once you climb the mountain, the rest is downhill.", "amor": "If you are trying to give some indication to someone of just how much they mean to you, then take advantage of the current astral energy to send them the perfect romantic message. You could even write a love poem, if you feel inspired enough to do so. Any gift that conveys the sincerity of your feelings will touch them deeply and make them aware of how much you care.", "trabajo": "Keep your nose out of other people's business today. A conflict between co-workers is likely to arise, but the bottom line is that it is not your problem so stay out of it before you get tangled in a battle that is simply not yours to fight."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You're terrific at following through with projects, Leo, but perhaps not so great at starting them. Today is the perfect time for you to prove this theory wrong. There's a great deal of force out there to help you boost your rocket off the launching pad. Take advantage of this energy and get to work on things you've been meaning to start but haven't gotten around to yet.", "amor": "The aspect at play brings certain home truths closer to home and may drive others farther away. Communication is more of a game to see who can guess the other's motives, rather than an enjoyable way to pass the hours away together. It is as though you are both trying to second-guess each other while at the same time pretending to be completely honest.", "trabajo": "The week is off to a strong start for you. Not only are you feeling emotionally confident and secure in yourself, but you are also extremely optimistic and open to new ideas and concepts. Your perspective is broad and you are willing to learn.\n \n \n \n "}, "scorpio": {"personal": "A friend might approach you with the idea of forming a partnership, and even propose drawing up a tentative agreement. This is definitely something worth looking into, Aries, although you should consider all the facts before committing. Success and good fortune are definitely in the works, whether through this partnership or not. Expect an important call from a romantic partner.", "amor": "Friends and partners continue to be extremely sociable at the moment, and you may find yourself inundated with requests for dates and outings. However, you don't want to annoy or play off two people, one against each other. You are hot property, and others seem wildly disposed toward you. You don't want to suffer from total burnout, so guard against excess. But then again, you can keep your options open.", "trabajo": "Stay focused on what you know instead of trying to penetrate into areas that you don't know anything about. You are better off delegating tasks to those who are more efficient at these things than trying to reinvent every single wheel yourself."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "The time has come to focus on your personal life, aquarius. Your life has certainly had its moments. During the past few months, it has been especially full of new and deep emotions. If you're persistent about keeping your determined frame of mind and course of action, you will attain the goals you've set for yourself.", "amor": "Sometimes we can just be together with our loved ones in silence, but today it is necessary to talk. This may be difficult, as you know you are on very rough ground over a certain issue. You need to make that first step to bridge the gulf that feels as though it is getting wider and wider. Use your innate courage and just jump. It won't be as bad as you fear, and will provide much needed relief for both of you.", "trabajo": "Missed appointments and missed phone calls have been commonplace during the past few weeks. Today, things ease up and messes become organized again, suggesting that these types of work-related incidents will be running smoothly again."}, "taurus": {"personal": "There's a certain quality in your personal relationships that motivates you in life, Pisces. This is one of the reasons why your emotions play an important role in the scheme of things. You're guided by your emotions. Today you will be in the best disposition to meet a lot of people who will give new impetus to your life.", "amor": "Current astral energies could confuse certain issues within a close relationship that had been fairly clear. You both enjoy being together, but may not be able to come to any decisions about how you would like to progress in the future. Don't fret about this now, as this will make matters even more muddy between you, just enjoy what you have today. Tomorrow will take care of itself.", "trabajo": "Connect with people who are thinking big. They won't be hard to spot on a day like today. These are the people who are thinking positive, who are happy, and who aren't afraid to take a major risk. These are your allies. Align with them at this time."}, "leo": {"personal": "An unexpected invitation to a social event could put you in touch with unusual, fascinating people, leo. Some of them may be involved in professions that interest you. Some may become your friends and others might prove to be valuable business contacts. New opportunities could come your way as a result. Whatever invitations come your way, don't turn them down. You might miss something wonderful.", "amor": "The planetary aspect that is forming may encourage you to be you more extravagant than you can actually afford. There is only so much in your pocket, and you may feel so trusting in the bountifulness of the universe to bring all you need that you want to take the special person in your life out for a really good meal. Just be sure you really do have the funds.", "trabajo": "Someone else's scattered and haphazard approach will create friction for you during the morning. Conflict with this person will be quite difficult to handle on all levels. Try not to make too much of a big deal out of it. Let it go and move on."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Get up and get going today, virgo. You have no time to lose. Your mind will be busy tackling many tasks, but this suits you just fine. You're well equipped to deal with the many frantic situations that are likely to come up. There's a great deal of strength to your emotions that you can use to connect with others and communicate your thoughts in a healthy manner.", "amor": "Today you may need to talk to your loved one about certain issues that have cropped up within the relationship. Suddenly you realize that there may be specific areas where you are both holding back from each other, and so need to broach the subject before it gets even more difficult in the future. Just get started, and it will all be fine.", "trabajo": "Calm down and think clearly. Lately you may have become reckless with your actions. This is the time to stop and sort out your wild ideas. Slow down. With a clear head, weed out the bad ideas from the good. Don't try to pursue all of them at once."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Someone has just turned on the fan and papers are flying everywhere, capricorn. The pace is picking up and you're scrambling to pick up the pieces. Stay in close communication with others today, for this will be your saving grace. You may require others' help to gather the documents that have blown across the room. Keep an eye on things so you don't lose your place.", "amor": "Patterns of thought are interfering with a course of action or a relationship with someone close that you are trying to resolve. The current planetary configuration is bringing these to the surface, allowing you to see the cause of the problems more clearly. You have a good chance of moving through this if you can talk about it with the person concerned. They will at least understand.", "trabajo": "Your dreamy, fanciful nature is useful, but only if it is coupled with concentration and focus. If you aren't being disciplined in your approach, then you will fall short of your goals today. Do your best to combine creativity with hard work."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Some intense dreams about someone you haven't seen for a long time could have you wondering what this person is doing now, Aries. It might also awaken the desire to be in contact again. Call if you can. You might be pleasantly surprised. An increased psychic sensitivity could cause you to better understand the thoughts and feelings of family members. Communication of all kinds should go well today.", "amor": "You do not want to end up in one of your darker moods as the day progresses. Why don't you first of all get some realistic perspective on what is actually happening? It isn't as if anything much has gone wrong, but more that your fears have taken you into areas that are not entirely the truth. You really need to start looking at some positives rather than the negatives.", "trabajo": "You may get scorned by a superior today for snoozing on the job. Don't let anyone see your lazy side, because you will get reprimanded for it. Other people are working hard, so you should as well. You will feel better about yourself when you do."}, "aries": {"personal": "The strange behavior of a romantic interest may have you confused, aries. Is your partner avoiding you? Do phone calls go unanswered? Forget it. Sometimes people see too much intimacy as a threat to their independence and choose to ignore it. The best way to deal with this is to not press any sensitive issues. Just go out for dinner and act like a friend. Keep romance out of the equation for now!", "amor": "You may be feeling cool and detached as usual, but someone who has had their eye on you for a while certainly isn't. Today's astral energy means that you may have an admirer who is determined to get to know you. You really need to have an honest conversation with them before you make any kind of instant judgments about their attitude. You might actually find them attractive.", "trabajo": "When you try to appeal to one group, you will only succeed in alienating another. When you adjust your strategy to appeal to the latter group, you will end up infuriating the former. Work so that you satisfy yourself regardless of others."}, "pisces": {"personal": "If you don't agree with what the group is doing today, pisces, don't feel like you have to join in. Earn their respect in your own way, not by forcing yourself into a mold you don't fit into. Maintain your integrity and act with confidence. If you're confident about your actions, others will put their confidence in you. Don't compromise your beliefs.", "amor": "If you are already in a strong relationship, the celestial configuration will bring the opportunity to deepen this by discussing those subjects that may be background issues, and that may need looking at further. There is a chance to clear up any matters, which though not too problematic, may just niggle. Then enjoy a wonderful evening together - with perhaps a romantic dinner out.", "trabajo": "Now is the time to take care of all the details that you have been ignoring lately. This is your big chance to cross your t's and dot your i's. Your eye for detail is much sharper than usual. Step out of the clouds and join others on planet Earth."}}
