{"libra": {"personal": "Today the stars advise you to get back into the swing of things, libra. You will forget your past frame of mind and be able to prepare for a new adventure.

You will probably meet someone who has a beneficial influence in the days to come.", "amor": "Love to you is an adventure, and a doorway full of promise. If you wish to create more romance in your life today, then be prepared to be a little bold, and to blow your own trumpet. Don't be shy about touting your accomplishments or talking about your many talents. It is this that will literally propel you into a new world, and hopefully to a new lover.", "trabajo": "As the day wears on, you will feel other people taking your ideas more seriously. Overall, you will be much more productive in the afternoon hours. Unexpected good fortune is coming to you today that will add a greater purpose to your work."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You may feel like you're on a road to adventure and excited about the frontiers you're encountering, Capricorn. Unfortunately, it seems that not everyone is as excited about this path as you are. Blows to your ego are apt to hit hard, but try not to let this deter you. This is more than likely a result of other people's jealousy of your incredible strength and bravery.", "amor": "This is a day when all those workshops on healing and transformation in relationships come to your rescue. The day's planetary alignment brings with it that urge for change, which has an almost preacher-like zeal about it. You are determined that the dear one in your life will glow like an angel and be absolutely spiritual and perfect. Don't forget to polish your own halo, as well.", "trabajo": "Other people are more likely to join your bandwagon than try to oppose it, so use this to your advantage. You have the ability to persuade others quite easily. This is a good time to gather support for a project that you are considering."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You may be hit with some extreme circumstances that cause you to feel uneasy about continuing along your path, Sagittarius. Use this jolt as a reminder that nothing is set in stone. An element of the unexpected can always creep up on you. Deep down, you probably had a feeling that this difficult situation was bound to happen eventually.", "amor": "With today's planetary configuration, you can hardly stay at home and read a book. You need to get out and about, and what's more, to go somewhere you find very inspiring. Perhaps you could hit the dance floor somewhere, go to a meditation meeting or yoga class, or walk along a beautiful beach. It is within this kind of atmosphere that you could encounter some wonderfully romantic moments.", "trabajo": "Don't let your good mood and strong self-confidence be squashed by someone else's immature behavior. There is a chance that others will try to engage you in their unenlightened way of thinking. Don't let this happen. Be strong in your point of view."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "You're likely feeling alert, strong, and full of energy and stamina. Your sense of adventure is high. You may be exploring the possibility of an interesting vacation - rafting, backpacking, or some other adventure. This is a good idea. This trend in your physical condition should continue for a while. Get some travel brochures and look into it!", "amor": "You may well feel as though you have been through enough changes. But today brings you to a new understanding. You really perceive what has contributed to your dilemma in terms of your current relationship, and would like to create a positive environment for a healing of any rift that may have occurred. You feel more than ready to make changes within yourself to accomplish this.", "trabajo": "At first you may reject the dreamy, fanciful, and whimsical ideas and people that come to you later in the day. Instead, however, you should embrace them. Progress is made when you break from your plan and dream big. Use your imagination."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "An event could find a current or potential love partner paying a lot of attention to others, aquarius. You might feel neglected and unloved, as though your friend is doing this to hurt you. This probably isn't the case. Your partner is just trying to be sociable and doesn't realize that it upsets you. Do some mingling. Your friend might have the same reaction as you and come running!", "amor": "The current planetary alignment implies that you have an opportunity to get in touch with someone who has inspired you to fall in love. Whatever the context of the conversation that you hold with them, it will be very encouraging, as it will be obvious that they have been feeling the same way about you for some time. You could have a great first date. Go for it!", "trabajo": "You will get frustrated at work today by people who are rather unorganized. Be patient with them, although this may not necessarily be easy for you. Realize that there is something valuable that you need to learn from them so listen carefully."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Desire is the name of the game today, taurus. If you want it, you can get it, but it won't come easily. The prize will go to the person who desires it the most. Show the people around you how much you can accomplish. You will impress others with your incredible drive and determination. Don't fall victim to the wasp that could sting you.", "amor": "The energy of the day is making your lover a little selfish, even though they don't intend to be mean or hold back. But perhaps there is a lesson in this for you, as well. You are often so worried about upsetting the apple cart that you will go with other's wishes to keep the peace. Perhaps it is time you spoke up for yourself, as well.", "trabajo": "Someone in the workplace is likely to pick a fight with you today. His or her actions are extremely immature. Remain strong in your position without resorting to childish tactics. Let your solid, trustworthy nature be an example to others."}, "leo": {"personal": "There is power behind your heart, leo, and you might come across more forcefully than usual in the love and romance department.

Spreading your love will ensure that people are happy to keep you warm on days when your fire sputters out.", "amor": "If you are dating anyone new tonight, then you may be in for a surprise. The day's planetary aspect makes this an occasion you cannot fail to remember. If you have been used to quiet manners, you are in for a shock. This one is wild, undisciplined, and will not do what you ask, but exactly what they feel like. You will probably have a truly fabulous time anyway.", "trabajo": "Put some extra finishing touches on your work today. Your tendency may be to get sloppy - especially as the day wears on. Instead, it is important that you completely tie up any loose ends and go the extra mile to impress the people around you."}, "virgo": {"personal": "In a philosophical or political conversation, you don't hesitate to offer your thoughts, Leo. Your examples may be extreme, but your principles are sound. You may get in over your head before you know it and suddenly need an escape route. Your first reaction may be to change the subject. It's better to admit you don't know the answer or don't understand the question.", "amor": "Today could bring a sudden rupture in a certain relationship, yet some surprising developments in another. It may be difficult to come to terms with this break, but it ultimately has a positive outlook, as it may have occurred because the relationship was becoming too stifling and restrictive. Once the need for freedom is established, perhaps there can be some positive talking.", "trabajo": "Your work ethic is incredibly strong today. You can accomplish a great deal, so don't be afraid to put twice as many items on your daily list than you normally would. Your powers of concentration are strong and the resources you need are present."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "The near future looks great for you, with auspicious omens for success and good fortune regarding career and money. All the hard work that you've done in the past may finally be paying off. Advancement is on the horizon, as well as increased income and much happiness. All signs are that you won't stop there. You're more likely to continue working toward new, more challenging goals.", "amor": "This could be a rather intense day, and one in which you may find yourself very much drawn to a certain person. If you think that you can pull away just like that, you may be mistaken - the magnetic attraction is just too strong. Watch out for being too possessive, or wanting your partner to be the way you want them to be, not as they are.", "trabajo": "Rely on your intuition instead of waiting for your rational mind to decide. Your head may have been swarming with conflicting ideas yesterday, but the answer should be clear today. Just tune into your gut feeling and make your decision."}, "gemini": {"personal": "There's extra action in your day today, gemini, so go with it. Don't fight against the wave of unconventional support that's brewing at your back door. There's a great deal of potential energy at your disposal. The only thing keeping you from harnessing it is your own mind. Don't be so scared of that which can actually help you out. Open your mind and let the new into your life.", "amor": "The office or your place of work could be where passion strikes you to the core of your being, given the current astral configuration. Although you may not have paid too much attention to this person in the past, you certainly will today, when a conversation you share suddenly makes you both realize that there is an unmistakable and powerful chemistry between you. An interesting situation is in the making!\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "Someone's immature approach in the workplace is likely to send your head spinning. Anger is welling up from within you and if you are not careful, you are likely to lash out in a manner that may scare the people around you. Try to be more patient."}, "aries": {"personal": "Social events or group activities concerned primarily with spiritual, metaphysical, social, or humanitarian issues could take place in your community today, aries. These could be enlightening and enjoyable, and you could make some new friends. The exchange of ideas could get your mind going a thousand miles an hour. Get a little exercise to clear your head or you might have trouble sleeping tonight.", "amor": "The current planetary alignment enables you to pretend up to a point, but will it actually help you in your current situation? If you have any ideas about how your adopted behavior may change your current relationship for the better, or keep a certain person by your side when they do not really want to be there, then it would be better to think again. Why can't you be yourself?", "trabajo": "Your fast-talking, quick-thinking ways will come in extra handy today. There will be many opportunities in which you will need to be thinking on your feet. Trust yourself to make these spontaneous decisions instead of spending hours deliberating."}, "pisces": {"personal": "There's little comfort in your emotions today, pisces. You may want to stick to business. Concentrate on getting things done in your regular routine. Create a plan and stick to it. This isn't a day to deviate from the norm, nor is it a time in which you will find much sympathy from others. Stick close to home and take care of your personal business. Time is precious. Don't waste it.", "amor": "Talking may seem a little more difficult today, especially where your closest relationships are concerned. The planetary configuration that is forming in the heavens brings a sense of estrangement. This may be because you have had too much work or other responsibilities and commitments that have meant sharing less time together. Although there may be some hurt feelings, take the time to be with them and tell them how you feel.", "trabajo": "You will get the feeling that others are not playing by the rules today. Your instincts are correct. Someone is taking a rather immature approach. He or she is bending the rules in order to get ahead. Don't be afraid to alert your superiors of this."}}
