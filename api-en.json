{"libra": {"personal": "A long-term project reaches a positive conclusion, one that may have a dramatic impact on your finances. You've sold your manuscript to a publisher or successfully concluded a project that's dear to your heart. This success should give you the confidence you need, libra. Don't forget to take time to celebrate!", "amor": "The current astral energy brings you much closer than you could have thought possible to someone who is the epitome of style and elegance. They have impressed you in the past with their flare and general fashion sense, but today in conversation you are even more impressed by their wisdom and their spiritual knowledge. They are obviously not just a pretty face, as you certainly intend to find out.", "trabajo": "If you aren't doing your job with passion, then why do it? Today is one of those days in which you should feel inspired to work harder than usual. If you aren't, then maybe you should consider finding new work. Your happiness depends on it."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Let yourself go into creative mode today, sagittarius. Drift into a whole other world. Escape your present reality and explore your fantasies through artistic endeavors. Dream as big as your mind will allow. There's no limit to the things that can be realized on a day like this. Push your limits and test your boundaries. You may be able to soar much higher than you think.", "amor": "If you are going out on a first date, then you may find that it will not be as passion filled as you had expected, at least for the moment. The current aspect indicates that you will tend to talk - but it could be through your conversation that your appreciation of each other develops by leaps and bounds. You are exploring some intriguingly taboo subjects through words alone.", "trabajo": "More power will come to you with the more knowledge you have. Consider taking on a course of study at this time. The more you learn, the more valuable you will be and the more leverage you will have in the workplace. New skills are priceless."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Much of your focus today will be on personal possessions and material goods in general, cancer. Think about what you can do to improve your home. Make your physical surroundings comfortable and inviting. Spend time alone in your sanctuary where you can center and concentrate on the big picture. Physical comfort and beauty will translate into emotional security.", "amor": "There are times when even you, who are patience and discipline incarnate, tend to go over the top with something. Today you could completely lose it concerning a certain person. Your fantasy button gets pressed, and before you know it, you are lost to the task in hand, and living some time in the future. Fantasy is fine within reason, but too much will bring you disappointment.", "trabajo": "The tables have turned and you are suddenly in very good standing with your boss and the people around you. Events in the workplace will go smoothly for you and your overall confidence will be stronger than usual. Ask for favors now - don't wait."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "This may feel like a day made just for you, Scorpio. You're emotionally strong. You feel like you're able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Tackle all those projects you love but have been too scared to start. You have a great deal of energy and confidence in your favor. You will succeed in almost anything you try, so don't waste this moment by just watching TV.", "amor": "You normally are very talkative, and it can be difficult to get a word in edgeways; however, with today's planetary configuration, you find yourself curiously unable to speak. It may be that what you have to talk about also involves a step into the unknown, and you are somewhat fearful of the consequences. But if you can take that first step, you will see the difference.", "trabajo": "A good deed you have done for someone else is going to bring you great reward today. It is possible that this very same person will do something helpful for you. It is also possible that this favor comes from someone completely unrelated."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You may have been saving up for something you really wanted, Cancer, when an unexpected expense compels you to spend some of your savings. This could cause some gloom. Make sure you've exhausted all of your other options before digging into your nest egg. Appearances could be deceiving. There could be other resources at your disposal that you didn't immediately think of.", "amor": "Partners may take you on a strange journey today. You could be going to places you have never been before, but that you will definitely wish to visit again. If you are single, you may meet someone ravishing and fascinating at a group or club where others share your own unique interests. Anywhere unusual or different would be the place to go.", "trabajo": "A brand new idea will come your way today that you are likely to jump on right away. Be careful of adopting it too hastily. This new idea is more based in fantasy than in reality. Ask others where the train is headed before you blindly jump aboard."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Thank your friends today, taurus. Let them know how much they mean to you. It's important to show your appreciation to the people around you. There's an expansive feeling in your heart that will shine through.

Share your smile and you can't go wrong.", "amor": "Today you have every chance of transforming a platonic relationship into one with passion, fire, and real guts. But somehow you need to get this message across to your intended one. They may never know if you do not speak up. Success is also dependent on the way you say it. Be sincere, and you will find a new joy in life.", "trabajo": "You have brilliant ideas and power behind them.

These things happen.", "amor": "The day's celestial configuration provides a great opportunity to shine a little light on a murky situation, and also to come to some kind of agreement about a few things that might have been troubling you recently. You can give your loved one a sense of security by making a fuss over them, taking them out to dinner, and just generally making them feel good.", "trabajo": "Break away from the normal routine.

Doing so is your key to a surge of creative energy in the workplace."}, "virgo": {"personal": "You may feel your life is full of uninteresting people. You think they're all alike and fit perfectly within a conservative society. You don't want to be like them and would prefer to meet unusual individuals, people who differ from the crowd. They aren't too far away. You just need to make an effort to look for them.", "amor": "Change is in the air today for all true romantics, plus a touch of spicy passion, as hot as a Thai curry. This day brings someone very interesting into your life.

It seems you don't really have much choice in the matter!", "trabajo": "Daydreams that you have today will actually prove to be quite useful.

For now, keep dreaming."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Today is a fantastic day for you, Aquarius, so enjoy yourself fully. Your emotions will be stable and you have a very expansive sense of well-being. Your self-confidence is strong, so use this to your advantage. This energy may be subtle, but if you tune into it early in the day and set a plan for what you want to accomplish, you can be very productive.", "amor": "Today's planetary energy may mean that someone feels a real attraction to you, but doesn't want to appear too pushy in case you are not ready to get involved in a relationship at this point. They are really keen to know you better, but are not sure how to begin to tell you. If you feel the same about them, then you could help by taking the initiative and telling them so.", "trabajo": "Long-term goals should not be ignored, so be careful of getting so caught up in the daily grind that you forget to look at the big picture. Use the power of the cosmos to take a step back and look at your situation. Both sides are illuminated now."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Romance with someone from far away who shares your spiritual inclinations could arise today. This could be a very intense, loving, and supportive relationship. Don't be shy, and don't let your insecurities get the better of you.

Get to know this person.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment means that you may find true love whilst learning about a new subject that has had you fascinated for some time.

Someone certainly does now!", "trabajo": "You may lay solid plans during the morning, but trying to follow through with these plans in the afternoon will be easier said than done. Unexpected events towards the end of the day will create a great deal of havoc. Be willing to adapt."}, "aries": {"personal": "The execution of contracts and other legal documents looks favorable now, aries.
