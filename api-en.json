{"libra": {"personal": "What are you waiting for, Pisces? Go for the gold. All you need to do is shine. You have the opportunity to merge with powerful groups today, so make sure to keep your eyes open. Do things that will improve your current status in a finance-related situation. Your sharp wit and endless facts and information will come in handy. Have a joke at the ready.", "amor": "How many times can you keep falling in love and then fall out again? The problem is that you have difficulty in committing yourself. You are often in the relationship, but not truly present. Today if you fall in love again, just ask yourself before it all ends in tears how far it can go. If it looks really promisingbe courageous and go ahead.", "trabajo": "Let your aggressive side come out today. Someone in the workplace may anger you and you may be tempted to stuff these feelings inside. Don't do it. Let them out. Fight back. You have a point of view that needs to be heard and respected."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Information received from far away could excite your passion to learn more about a subject, sagittarius. You might be inspired to use your new knowledge in a project that includes a partner. Your mind is extremely insightful at this time, so if you face decisions, this is the day to follow your heart. Don't be surprised if you find your telepathic abilities expanded as well!", "amor": "Some days bring a momentous task with them, and this could be one of them. You may have been holding a grudge against your current lover. You now feel the need to change your perspective and your attitude, not to mention your problem of being a little possessive. It's no wonder that your partner gave you a hard time; you may have dished it out first.", "trabajo": "Today brings you tremendous confidence and courage that you haven't felt in the past few days. Finally you feel like yourself again. You are reborn as the brave warrior that you are. Use this to your advantage and make corrections to recent mistakes."}, "cancer": {"personal": "People may be coming on strong, but you will be right there to meet them with an equally powerful rebuttal, Scorpio. The problem is, the person who confronts you is talking about apples and you're talking about oranges. Get off your soapbox for a minute and listen to the real issue. Don't get caught in misunderstandings or things could backfire later.", "amor": "To talk about the things you like spending your time doing could be embarrassing. You adore work even when on holiday, and you also love your ability to organize and to achieve through discipline. You certainly have your work cut out today to get really relaxed concerning a certain issue. You need to surrender your worries and enjoy yourself.", "trabajo": "Gears have switched. You are suddenly in a different place today than you were in yesterday. You are in a better place nowa more confident place. The actions you take will be much better supported by the people and events around you."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Your ego is strong today, scorpio, and you have a strong will. This is a good time to put your plan for world domination into effect. Be sure you channel your powerful emotions into positive outlets. Create rather than destroy. Energy that isn't used in a positive way will end up manifesting as accidents or hostility toward people who don't deserve it.", "amor": "How can you expect to ever settle down, when so much seems to be coming to a boil all around you at the moment. Just as think you deserve a little rest, you find that something makes you seize up in a fit of anxiety. Romance at the moment is very passionate and intense; in fact, it could even involve a touch of obsession. Just take it easy if you can.", "trabajo": "Patience will be required to deal with someone who doesn't have as much foresight as you do. When push comes to shove, don't be afraid to pull out your arsenal of facts that you have slowly and diligently been collecting. You will triumph."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You might feel a bit tense, Capricorn, and you probably won't understand why. The reason? The planets. You might jump at unexpected noises or take offense where none is intended. Relations with others might be a little strained, necessitating some communication about how you're feeling. Try to work off the tension by taking a brisk walk or perhaps working out at the gym.", "amor": "Sometimes you may justly be accused of sitting through a romantic evening with the Moon full out in the sky, and not even notice that touch of magic. Therefore this is to remind you to perceive what is in the air today. Don't have your sights set too far into the future, because what is immediately at your feet holds a great deal of power and mystery.", "trabajo": "                \nYou feel a bit of pressure at the current time because you are not following a prescribed \"path\" of some sort. Your approach is not necessarily a traditional one, and so perhaps you feel like it is invalid. Don't. Your way is the right way for you.\n                \n              "}, "taurus": {"personal": "Guard your heart well today, Aries. It's a prime target for the abrasive words being tossed around. Your sensitivity leaves you feeling alone and naked in the harsh atmosphere. You might be better off staying in bed. If you decide to go out, be prepared. Know your weaknesses so you can use your energy resources most efficiently.", "amor": "Current planetary energies may reawaken feelings for someone you had previously been in a relationship with. Whether you have suddenly found yourself thinking about them intensely, or happened to see them while out, you will certainly feel like getting in touch and speaking with them further. It may be that there is still some unfinished business to attend to, or that you have something important to discuss.", "trabajo": "                \nJust because something is labeled \"work\" doesn't mean that it has to be tedious or boring. Try to put some spark in your workday today with an extra positive attitude. Believe it or not, you can make this day fun whether you are working hard or not.\n                \n              "}, "leo": {"personal": "You may feel like someone caught in a tornado, leo. Things are whirling around you and everything seems out of control. Don't get stressed out. There's nothing you can do about it. Allow the storm to do what it will. You will only get hurt if you try to stop it. Accept things you have no control over. The storm will settle down soon.", "amor": "Conversations today hold the key to a potentially romantic encounter. However, there is a little conflict involved; possibly issues on which you hold opposing views. But don't let that stop you from continuing your discussion at a later date. You will get to appreciate each other's wonderful qualities even if you can't always agree on absolutely everything.", "trabajo": "In an atmosphere in which people are being very rigid and stuck in their ways, your easygoing and adaptive attitude will be a welcome relief to the people around you. Don't underestimate the wonderful benefits of your sweet and generous nature."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Today is your day to dream big, Capricorn. Think about what you want most out of life. Aim at the stars. There's no limit to how far you can go. Your only limitation is your imagination. Don't worry if your plan doesn't seem to make rational sense. Worry more about what you want and less about how you're going to get it.", "amor": "Although perhaps it is passion of a different kind, today's astral energy means that you will have quite a lot to give in the romance department. There is a more earthy quality that translates your fantasies into reality. It is the fantasies that could bridge the gap and start the healing which needs to take place physically. Have a great day; your partner definitely will!", "trabajo": "The frenzy of the morning dies down in the late afternoon, and you are finally able to sort out all the broken pieces of the puzzle. You no longer have to turn to others for the answers, since everything comes to you naturally and easily."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Your mind is surprisingly clear today, capricorn, and your thinking fits in line with what your ego has set out to accomplish. The key for you is to let your emotions speak. Take charge and let yourself go after what you want. While you've spent the last couple days in contemplation, the next few days should be more action oriented.", "amor": "This is a day that may make you very aware that you have quite a way to go before you can really explain to your latest romantic conquest just how you feel. You have been fantasizing about them for some time, and now that it has actually come to the crunch, you are a little overwhelmed. You need to rebuild your self-esteem and learn to love yourself.", "trabajo": "A slow and steady pace will serve you well. Your thinking is clear and logical, helping you to sort through the uncertainty and confusion that surrounds you. Other people are unpredictable and scattered. Don't get distracted by their drama."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Your heightened sensitivity could get you in trouble today, gemini. The more you try to pin down a specific answer to something, the more resistance you may encounter. Don't expect a straight answer from anyone or you will be disappointed. People may be flighty or forgetful. Try not to take anything too seriously today.", "amor": "If you love fantasy or poetic writing, then you will be in a very creative frame of mind today. In pursuit of your love, you may meet someone who also knows a thing or two about how to write verse. By charming each other with romantic sonnets, you could discover that you share far more than words alone.", "trabajo": "You have a good handle on what is going on today, but realize that you aren't fully tuned into EVERYTHING. Realize that there are still aspects that are unfamiliar to you. You are better off admitting this than pretending you know when you don't."}, "aries": {"personal": "Take an adventurous approach, Taurus, especially when it comes to love and romance. Don't get moody or down in the dumps when things don't seem to be going your way. It's up to you to change your attitude. Trust that things will improve when you turn the corners of your mouth up instead of down. Stop worrying about every little issue that comes up. Take it all in stride.", "amor": "Life is for living, and you could do a lot of this today, with the current astral alignment. If you have found yourself resisting the urge to tell a loved one exactly how you feel, then you will discover that today, in stark contrast, you want to shout it from the rooftops and let everyone know. Your reluctance to share vanishes in a powerful surge of deep emotion.", "trabajo": "Other people are not speaking your language today. This makes it difficult for you to get anything accomplished in the workplace. Do your best to concentrate on your own tasks without letting others confuse you with their opinions."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Your head may be going in a thousand different directions today, Sagittarius. You may not have much time to stop and think about your next move. Things will come up suddenly and you will need to be able to react quickly. The faster you move, the less time you will have to react. For this reason, you may want to consider a side route where things are flowing a bit more slowly.", "amor": "Deep, deep talking keeps you begging for more. The day's planetary alignment means that conversation leads into waters you may have only considered dipping your toe into until now. \"Commitment\" is one word that may be mentioned; the other is that word \"love.\" You may find that you started the day with a great relationship, and end it with the feeling that you have discovered your soul mate.", "trabajo": "You are indestructible today, so use this high-energy period to your advantage. You can accomplish a great deal by simply tuning into your wonderful confidence and exuberant personality. This is a great time to present a new plan or make a deal."}}
