{"libra": {"personal": "Just because everyone else is walking on eggshells doesn't mean you need to, Virgo. Your upbeat spirit will be more welcome than usual due to the drama around you. Be careful of falling into the role that you know others want you to play. It's easy to take on the role that's in front of you, but this doesn't always help the situation. Read from your own script, not someone else's.", "amor": "Today's alignment of the planets may mean you are not quite sure how to approach a certain subject, even though it ought, theoretically, to be a pleasure to talk about. You feel in your heart that your new lover is quite passionate about you, and yet they may not have actually said so. You get the sense that they are not being honest, even though they exhibit adoration for you.", "trabajo": "Make sure there are elements of your work that you truly believe in. If you aren't mentally and spiritually committed to what you are doing, then why do it? Because of the money? Trust that you can earn money doing something you are passionate about."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Today a charismatic, artistic woman could visit your home, sagittarius. She could have a lot of ideas to discuss, perhaps proposing that you work on a project together. This might be a good idea, but don't commit to it now. Your friend has a way of getting people all excited and clouding their judgment. Wait until she leaves and take some time to think. You'll be in a better space then.", "amor": "Much as you may feel extremely sorry for someone with whom you have recently shared a close relationship, the planetary alignment indicates that it could be time to say goodbye. You realize that although there was a certain depth of affection between you, somehow you were not ideally suited in other ways. Rather than both mourning your losses, why not celebrate your newfound freedom?", "trabajo": "You are on the verge of something big, but you feel as if not all the pieces are in place. They're not, so hold on. There is no sense in jumping the gun. You are better off waiting until everything is perfectly in place before making your move."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Your mind may be going in many different directions, with fantastic ideas about how things should be done, Cancer. The difficulty is communicating these ideas in a way that makes sense. Others may see you as a threat to their authority. Perhaps they feel your ideas would undermine their plans, so they reject them. Don't give up. Fight for your right to be heard and respected.", "amor": "Some secret fires are burning right now. There is a powerful energy in the atmosphere that could really transform for the better any relationship you would like to see changed. The key is taking action when it seems appropriate. You will most certainly get a chance to deepen a significant relationship; and you would be wise to take it.", "trabajo": "You are starting to see the light on a problem that you have been wrestling with in association with your career. Long-term goals that seemed impossible are now within your reach. Pay attention to what others say today. The answer is there."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Today is one of those days in which prosperity is much closer than you think, Scorpio. You may know what you seek, but it's up to you to take the first step toward going after it. You're probably looking for solid answers to your deep, probing questions. Don't let your inquisitive mind rest until you find answers that ring true for you.", "amor": "There is quite an intense energy in the air. The day's planetary configuration indicates that the subtle fantasies you may be entertaining concerning someone close, or whom you would like to become close to, may have a profound effect upon you today. An idea may stir you into action, and no matter what the reality of the situation may be, you decide to make a significant move.", "trabajo": "Your emotions may be a bit deceiving, so make sure you have your head screwed on tightly before making any big moves. Your mood may end up dictating all your actions today and this is likely to turn you away from your true career path. Be careful."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "There's a great wind under your wings today, Taurus, and you may find the day's energy quite transforming. You now have the opportunity to make great strides in whatever you wish to accomplish. It may be time for you to make an important change in your current attitude. Embrace differences in perspective and opinion. Varied opinions can help you understand a situation.", "amor": "You can talk all you like, but one issue today is of particular importance. This is connected with the past, and to certain attitudes you held in former times. Although this may not seem too important, you need to talk to your partner about this in order to clear up certain misgivings that they may be having. It can only improve things.", "trabajo": "Someone in your workplace is taking shortcuts and being rather lazy overall. Meanwhile, you are slaving away and doing twice the work that he or she is doing. Don't get angry. The other person will get what he or she deserves, and so will you."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Your new approach to things might get some flack from superiors today, Scorpio, but don't let that stop you. Realize that your independent and somewhat rebellious nature helps to keep the world in balance. Don't give up the fight when authorities insist that their way of doing things is best when in fact it's simply old. Use your will and determination to combat the forces from above.", "amor": "Sometimes your love life really sparkles. Today those flashes of brilliance have a slightly escapist edge to them. You may well find that a heady combination of circumstances means that you are swept off your feet before you even got up to dance. You will feel completely spellbound. So don't promise your all on the strength of what happens today. But do, by all means, enjoy yourself.", "trabajo": "Trying to extract information from others will not be easy today. You will find yourself probing for quite a while to find the answers you want, but unfortunately, they do not come without resistance. Be patient instead of pushy and you will succeed."}, "leo": {"personal": "Add a bit of spark to your day, Sagittarius. Get yourself into gear. It might feel like there's a great deal of anticipation in the air, but don't get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the day you've been given, and make sure you use every minute to its fullest potential. Small annoyances may turn into large headaches unless you maintain an honest mind and neutral standpoint.", "amor": "The planetary energy means that there is no stopping you today when it comes to love and romance. If you have your sights set on some poor unsuspecting person and intend, one way or another, to get a date with them, then it seems they have no choice but to comply. Right now the word \"no\" does not exist in your vocabulary, at least in this respect.", "trabajo": "Your ideas are more inventive and cutting edge than usual today so pay attention to the flashes of brilliance that will come your way during the workday. These ideas can take you quite far if you take the initiative to implement them properly."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Spend time with good friends today, Scorpio. Share dinner with people you love and feel free to be generous with the food and drink. You have the ability to control just about every situation. Remind others that they're part of a greater whole and that working together is the key to accomplishing great feats. Inspire others to be the best they can be.", "amor": "Conversation is the way to the heart of someone you find extremely attractive. The celestial energy indicates that all you need do is to tell them how you feel; but rather than go overboard with passionate overstatements about all their wonderful qualities, keep it simple. Lightly touch on your emotions - rather like you might mention only once that you adore gold, and leave it at that.", "trabajo": "Take a more creative approach to your work today. Write things down in a graphic, colorful way instead of in a straight list with bullet points. If you have a presentation to make, liven it up with vivid charts and diagrams instead of just words."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You may think few people understand you, capricorn. Even if you try to explain your thought process and where you are emotionally, it still seems like others are more concerned with themselves. Only you can really understand how you feel. Be your own cheerleader. It isn't necessary for everyone to understand everything about you. An air of mystery is part of what makes you intriguing.", "amor": "People with very dissimilar natures often find each other very attractive, and this may be the case with today's alignment of the planets. If you are attending a party or other social occasion, you may meet someone with whom you feel an instant rapport. There is something about the pair of you that is both very different and yet also very much the same. Have fun!", "trabajo": "Your attitude at the beginning of the day will determine how others treat you throughout the rest of the day. Don't give other people a reason to dislike you or be disrespectful to you. You deserve to be treated like the best because you are the best."}, "gemini": {"personal": "A friend could seem distant today, gemini, and probably won't be communicating with you much. Don't jump to the conclusion that your friend is upset with you. If anything, this person is probably worried about his or her job. Just be your usual friendly self, don't push, and go about your business. Your friend will talk when the time is right.", "amor": "You may find the atmosphere between you and your dearest love a bit too sentimental and romantic for your liking today, and this may incline you to be somewhat distant in order to avoid having to deal with it. Today's position of the heavenly bodies is actually putting you more deeply in touch with your feelings, and this is making you feel uncomfortable. Be patient with yourself.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "You are in a very difficult bind today and it seems that the more you struggle to get yourself free, the more tightly you are bound to your situation. You may want to consider a new approach since it is clear that the old one is not working."}, "aries": {"personal": "Desire is the name of the game today, Leo. If you want it, you can get it, but it won't come easily. The prize will go to the person who desires it the most. Show the people around you how much you can accomplish. You will impress others with your incredible drive and determination. Don't fall victim to the wasp that could sting you.", "amor": "A social evening could mean that one meeting proves to be an eye-opener in more ways than you can imagine. The current aspect breaks down a barrier that has existed between you and someone else with whom you secretly feel a powerful connection. Perhaps because of this you have been hesitant to speak to them; but an accident of fate means you have no choice. Thank goodness.", "trabajo": "You will have a burst of physical energy today that will inspire you to tackle many projects with little difficulty. Just make sure that you don't annoy others as you do so. Your tendency may be to steamroll over people to get certain things done."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Things should go well for you today as long as you can keep the drama to a minimum. You can jump over any hurdle in your way, so don't worry about a thing. You have a sharp, intuitive wit about you that's grounded in the real world. Take care of the details and plan your next big move. Clean, organize, and throw away things that no longer serve you.", "amor": "Today's astral energy could mean you have quite an interesting day as far as love and romance is concerned. You could change your mind about one particular person several times in the space of a few hours. In fact you may be trying to decide between two different people. You won't be able to get any definite answer in this frame of mind. It is better to wait.", "trabajo": "Right now is a good time to re-locate or change positions. Even a small change can have a huge impact on your life. Moving to the next town over, or the next office over can make a big difference on your attitude toward going to work every morning.\n \n \n \n "}}
