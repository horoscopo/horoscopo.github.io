{"libra": {"personal": "You may feel as if you're the only one who picks up on the nuances of conversations and actions around you, Aquarius. Your reaction to things is more than likely quite strong and will have a much greater impact on you now. Use this day to turn things around. It's time for you to create a stir. Be more dynamic and outer directed so you have a chance to release some of that inner energy.", "amor": "It depends what your motives are as to whether you decide to play today or not. The astral configuration can get you involved in some very philosophical discussions, and some very intricate conversations. If you can be bothered, it will be because you see that after hours of chin wagging you may get something a little more to your liking: the total undivided attention of your beloved. It is not likely you will go through all this for nothing.", "trabajo": "Think of your superiors as your friends and your allies instead of thinking of them as your enemies. It is better to have these people on your side, so do your best to work with them instead of against them. A friendly remark and a smile will go far."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Today is a significant day, astrologically speaking, sagittarius. It may be an affirmation of your pioneering spirit. Be the champion of the new and bizarre. There's a window of opportunity opening to reveal a golden chance. Forces that seem to conflict may actually work well together. Remember to balance old traditions with new information. The integration of these is key.", "amor": "Relationships tend to move in cycles, as I'm sure you have noticed. Just when we think that everything is going really well, we discover that we have forgotten to do something we promised, or just plain forgot to take notice when we should have. Today, talking through some of the things that you regret may make progress very possible and also very swift. You will feel greatly relieved.", "trabajo": "Calculated risks are key to your success today. You have the potential to do extremely well for yourself. Don't underestimate your good luck. You operate under a very lucky star and this luck has the potential to bring tremendous fortune your way."}, "cancer": {"personal": "If you're unclear about the topic of discussion, say so, Aries. Asking questions is an important part of learning. You shouldn't be afraid to ask. Communication may take on a serious tone, and intellectual discussions are likely to get heated. Bring up political topics at the dinner table and give everyone a chance to speak on the matter. Don't try to change the subject in order to avoid the conversation.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment helps you to feel more mellow and relaxed than you have for some time. If you are going out on a date, then it will probably be a very romantic and memorable occasion. You will be surprised at how easily you are charmed into submission by all the right kinds of attention, but do keep one foot on the ground at least.", "trabajo": "Values and personal beliefs are coming to the forefront. What is important to you? Are you doing work that resonates with your own personal belief system? Are you getting paid a fair amount or do you deserve more? Be honest with yourself."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "An extra log has been thrown on your fire today, Taurus, so don't be surprised if you burn especially hot. Use your internal furnace to make some breakthroughs and bring matters to a higher level. Turn up the intensity on certain issues that require more life. You will bring a great deal of positive energy to just about everything you touch, so use it wisely.", "amor": "Today's planetary energy means that you have a golden opportunity to get to know someone much better, as fate steps in and brings you face-to-face with them. Although your intuition tells you that there is definite potential in this connection, it is not until you start a conversation that you appreciate just how much. You find each other intriguing and delightful.", "trabajo": "Use the wisdom of others to help you make the final push on a project that you are hoping to complete soon. You may have exhausted your own ideas. Now is the time to draw on the ideas of someone new. A fresh perspective is all you need."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You're at a creative high point right now, so make sure to nurture this side of your being, Pisces. It could be that you're in danger of running into an obstacle. Try not to get discouraged. Instead, it may be best for you to reflect on what you've done in the past. Enjoy emotional stability today instead of letting your emotions jump around from one thing to the next.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "With today's planetary configuration, you feel very full of the magic of life. You can do a lot to improve your romantic life, but it needs to be based on reality, and not on idle promises. You have the possibility of having a good day, but if you say that you are going to take your dearest to Paris for lunch, then mean it - otherwise there could be problems.", "trabajo": "Moving forward with projects today will be much easier than you might have expected. If you are in the market for a new job, today is a good time for you to get out there and search. Something is sure to come your way. Lady luck is on your side."}, "taurus": {"personal": "You may not necessarily approve of the behavior of the people around you, Leo, but that doesn't mean you need to make their lives miserable. Be more accepting of others. Don't feel like you need to teach people a lesson simply because you don't understand their ways of life. You may be jumping to conclusions without taking the time to understand the situation.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "Relationships can go one of two ways today. There is a possibility of greater harmony and cooperation, or the potential for out-and-out conflict - or even a little of both. You need to understand what makes you both unique and different; but you also need to see exactly what it is that draws you both together. This will help smooth the way.", "trabajo": "The key focus for you today is to balance fantasy with reality. Both certainly do have their merits so don't completely trade in one for the other. Success will be yours if you can find a way to integrate both concepts into your current plan."}, "leo": {"personal": "You may be tormented by an important decision today, leo. The good news is that once you make up your mind, you will feel much better about yourself. Until then, however, you may vacillate from one side to the other. Asking others for advice may put you in even more of a quandary. The only one who can decide your path is you.", "amor": "If you are single and looking for love, then it would benefit you to take yourself away to somewhere with a foreign or exotic feel to it, even if it is only a mile down the road. The day's celestial configuration suggests that if you lose yourself in another culture or different set of beliefs, the one you are looking for may find you, and fast at that!", "trabajo": "There is no need to get upset or uptight about anything. Do your best to relax. The more calm and relaxed you are, the calmer the people around you will be. This kind of environment fosters growth and overall good relations in the workplace."}, "virgo": {"personal": "This is a wonderful day. You feel emotionally strong, Cancer. You have all of your energy available for use. Don't miss this opportunity by feigning a headache and staying at home doing nothing. Instead of analyzing everything and criticizing everyone else's life, look at your own and see what choices you can make right now. Take the best course of action based on the resources you have at your fingertips.", "amor": "You may feel that someone is trying to push you more quickly into a relationship then you are prepared to go. The alignment of the planets creates a very energetic atmosphere in which those who are determined enough find it hard to put up with any obstacles. Perhaps you need to say exactly why you feel as you do - that is, if you want any peace.", "trabajo": "Plan an event or a meeting in which you can showcase your talents. Don't be afraid to toot your own horn. Oftentimes, your hard work gets lost in the shuffle behind others who are more arrogant about their achievements. You deserve praise too."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "When the thought of going to work makes it hard to get out of bed, know that the time has come to get another job, capricorn. Alas, that's probably not something you can do now. You can be extra kind to yourself. Give yourself a present. Find something you thoroughly enjoy that would perk up your spirits and cost little.", "amor": "You find the kind of love that sentimental movies are made of to be somewhat stifling, even smothering. Generally, the thought of someone responding to your every whim, willing to do everything you ask makes you feel sick, rather than elated. The day's planetary lineup may make some people's dreams come true, but you could find it something of a nightmare.", "trabajo": "You have a good handle on what is going on today, but realize that you aren't fully tuned into EVERYTHING. Realize that there are still aspects that are unfamiliar to you. You are better off admitting this than pretending you know when you don't."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Other people may find it difficult to deal with today's intensity, Aries, but you will be quite adept at fitting into whatever situation comes your way. The waters may get quite rough, especially when it comes to love and romance, but know that the boat you're on is seaworthy. There's also room for others, so let more people on board.", "amor": "Today's astral configuration may encourage you not to hold back when out on your date this evening. There is a warm atmosphere in the air that helps you to get over any attacks of nerves and soothes any potential panic attacks. The only kind of conversation that you don't want to get involved in is anything associated with illness - unless they, too, enjoy discussing lists of symptoms.", "trabajo": "There is a very expansive feeling to the day and whatever idea you have will be multiplied or amplified in some way. This is fine, but make sure you verify your intensions with others before moving forward recklessly. Check in before you proceed.\n \n \n \n "}, "aries": {"personal": "Some paperwork might need attention today, aries. You may also be on the phone a lot. Communication should be clear, open, and honest, so you'll accomplish exactly what you need to. An intimate and loving conversation could take place between you and a close friend or lover who might follow up with a visit to your home.", "amor": "The current astral energy gives you a chance to sweep the decks, throw away all the dead wood that has accumulated in your romantic life, and with a clear conscience, enables you to move onto greener and more promising pastures. You may have been wallowing in the mire recently in terms of your love life, but now realize what has to be done, and you go ahead and do it.", "trabajo": "Your current plans may stop dead in their tracks today thanks to someone who has a rather backward notion of the situation at hand. It seems that someone's belief system is clogging up the works in a rather negative way. Open the door for dialogue."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Today you might feel a little out of sorts, pisces, perhaps because of overindulgence from last night. You might be tempted to stay home in spite of other commitments. This actually might be a wise course of action, though you may feel better by midafternoon. Spend the morning relaxing and taking care of yourself. See what the rest of the day brings.", "amor": "The day's celestial configuration may be a little disturbing for you, as it may seem that no one wants to play. Everyone is caught up in their own personal dramas of woe and worry. As you thrive on the openness and flow in relationships, you may find this hard to deal with. Don't take it personally, as the mood will pass; set an example and keep smiling yourself.", "trabajo": "The truth is very blurred, and facts are only going to get more confusing as the day wears on. The more people you talk to, the more bewildered you will become. Try not to make any major decisions at this time. Wait until the path is clearer."}}
