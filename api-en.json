{"libra": {"personal": "One of the themes today is giving versus receiving. You may be asked to handle many tasks at once, something you're naturally quite good at, Pisces. There's a strong need to take action and get things done, while you may also feel a strong inward pull asking you to settle down and reflect. Both are valid emotions, and both should be honored as you go through your day.", "amor": "The current planetary energy encourages you to consider what your motives are for wanting to get involved in one particular relationship. If you search your heart and think that you may get something quite specific out of it, then you may actually be taking the wrong attitude. Perhaps it may be more pertinent to ask yourself what it is that you have to givethen make a decision.", "trabajo": "This will be a busy day for you, but that is fine. You will use the energy given to you to accomplish a great dealin many different areas. Tackle many small, short errands. Knock them off your list one by one. You will be quite efficient."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Today you will tend to analyze your life. You will think about your lifestyle and the food you eat. Are you eating foods that are good for your body? Are you exercising enough? The stars will help you focus on your health. Health-promoting activities are recommended today, sagittarius. Try to relax and find a sport you enjoy.", "amor": "In order for you to really come out on top with today's celestial energy, you need to keep oriented as to which way is vertical and which is horizontal. This is because your sense of direction may leave a lot to be desired. What you will find is that if you can stay calm and detached, even the most difficult and trying circumstances with your loved one will turn out just fine.", "trabajo": "You are a good judge of what is good and what is bad. You have a strong knowledge of the truth, so don't be afraid to share this knowledge with the people you work with. During the morning is when you efforts will be most useful and applicable."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Today's powerful astral phenomena will encourage you to develop your skill as a visionary, Scorpio, no matter what you do with your day. You're one of those rare people who can sense before anyone else the changes that will happen in the world. Let these feelings encourage you. Use them to believe in tomorrow.", "amor": "You could encounter that special person in some unlikely places. The day's planetary configuration indicates that you have a chance of your eyes meeting across a crowded doctor's waiting room, veterinary office, at work, or while seeing someone at a hospital. There will be a sense of attraction, and the feeling you have always known each other. This could be wonderful, so go with the flow.", "trabajo": "                \nA wonderful new seven-year cycle has just begun in which your talents of sensitivity and intuition are more on the \"in\" than on the \"out\". Consider moving into fields of work that you have fantasized about, which help put your psychic abilities to work.\n                \n              "}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Romance blossoms for you, Libra, perhaps after a long standstill. A new stability and security may settle on love relationships as well as close friendships. Children could be a great source of warmth and pleasure. You might want to channel some of this blossoming positive energy into a creative activity of some kind, which should increase even further your sense of contentment and well-being.", "amor": "The current aspect could be a liberating influence as far as your feelings are concerned. If you have been rigidly maintaining a particular stance or outlook in order to make sure that one relationship doesn't get out of hand, then you could actually be subconsciously making things worse. It may be best to let go and allow your heart to melt. This may be better than you imagine.", "trabajo": "Although your concentration may be strong, it may be difficult to keep focused, since someone else keeps pushing your buttons. You get the feeling that someone is trying to start a war with you. Don't let yourself slip down to their level."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Issues may get a little heavier than you'd like today, aquarius. Your job is to infuse some levity and humor into the situation. Your adaptability will be put to the test as other people remain steadfast in their opinions. Be conscious of how you use your words. Other people, especially superiors or elders, may be offended by careless, offhand remarks.", "amor": "Emotions could be volatile today. You may exhibit a tendency toward being very selfishunusual for you and your partner. This could be a clue to spend some time apart doing what you enjoy the most. It will give you both a chance to regenerate yourselves so that when you meet again later, you will relate in a meaningful way.", "trabajo": "You feel like you are being left behind. The world seems to be moving too fast and you are having trouble keeping up. This feeling will lead to frustration that will debilitate you even more. Don't get frustrated. Be calm and do what you can."}, "taurus": {"personal": "There might be tension in the air for no discernible reason today. Family members might seem preoccupied with problems they can't define. Your natural inclination could be to try to cheer them up, Virgo, but it probably won't work. Don't be annoyed if they don't respond. It isn't them. Blame the planets. This is a great day to jog, take a cardio class, or otherwise work off stress.", "amor": "As you usually love to cook, you will be surprised at what you find on the menu. Today the romantic beginning that looked so promising seems to be turning into a race to see who can be the more learned of the two of you. Season your stories with some interesting anecdotes and you'll have a palatable enough dish for two.", "trabajo": "Follow your gut instinct and you will be blessed with flashes of brilliance today. Great ideas will come out of the blue and you will surely want to grab hold of them. There is no need to hesitate or delay; just act. You are on the track toward success."}, "leo": {"personal": "Daydreams and fantasies about faraway lands and exotic places might have you thinking about dropping everything and taking off for a while. You aren't usually impulsive, leo, but today you feel restless. If you have no obligations, and if weather permits, go someplace where you can experience a change of scenery. We all need it from time to time.", "amor": "The quality of optimism pervades the day. You have a wonderful opportunity to meet with others who share your interests in the fields of art and creativity. Attending an exhibition, or perhaps socializing with a pre-dinner drink are possible activities where you may encounter that special person. There is a lot of laughter in the air, so have a good time!", "trabajo": "Overall, your thinking is quite clear and grounded, but someone else is planting seeds of doubt in your head. Someone with a rather inflated view of himself is blatantly against your current mode of thought. Align with your truth, not someone else's.\n \n \n \n "}, "virgo": {"personal": "Your inspiration and imagination are soaring today, Gemini. You may want to try an artistic project of some kind. You could be pleasantly surprised at the results. Your intuition is also high, and your understanding of those around you is greatly increased. Don't be afraid to act from instinct. This is one of those days when it should win out over rationality and logic!", "amor": "Don't worry if you are not quite sure about how your current relationship is progressing. Today's astral alignment means you could discover over the course of the day that you have been wondering whether they really care about you or not. Your intuition tells you that they do very much, and yet their actions at the moment may not seem to reflect this. Trust what your heart is telling you.", "trabajo": "Trying to convince people of your ideas will fail today unless you have feelings and passion behind your words. Others will be able to see right through a flimsy idea that has no solid support. Be prepared before you present yourself to others."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Just when you thought things were settled, life takes another turn. Today brings yet another of those turns, so hold on, Cancer. You may receive some information that has a dramatic impact on your life. Perhaps you'll receive an opportunity to move to another state or country. Perhaps you'll decide to get married. One thing is clearyour future looks promising!", "amor": "Drinking exotic cocktails on a moonlit beach with the sound of Spanish guitar music in the background may sound ideal, but it couldn't last forever. Life intrudes and business has to be attended to. However, you can make the right kind of magic anywhere. All you need to do is create the right atmosphere. Your sweetie will have no option but to swoon at your feet.", "trabajo": "Be open to other people's ideas, even if they don't necessarily match up with your own. Integration with others is easier than doing battle with others. Take this concept to heart regardless of whom you are dealing with. It will serve you well."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Don't be surprised if you're a little weepy today, Scorpio. The day's planetary influences could enhance your sensitivity to everything, including your feelings. Let yourself cry if you need toit can be cleansing. Try not to wallow too much, as things will look better tomorrow. Take good care of yourself today.", "amor": "You may be feeling just a touch sulky today. If your dearest one asks you ever so gently (they wouldn't dare do otherwise) what is the matter, you assume a wonderful pouting expression. You could keep this up forever, but that is an awful long time. It may be preferable to grow up and act your age. Your partner will certainly appreciate it.", "trabajo": "You have been purposefully avoiding a confrontation for quite a while. You don't want to get caught in a battle with someone, and so you have playing the role of \"Mr. Nice Guy/Gal\". Don't be afraid of being aggressive. It will behoove you to do so.\n \n \n \n "}, "aries": {"personal": "Someone who lives near you who may not have said much to you before could suddenly strike up a conversation that results in a new friendship, Virgo. You could be wondering why you didn't speak to him or her before. You could share a number of interests, and because of that, you could learn about some new group activities. Don't push too hard, and don't idealize your new friend.", "amor": "With today's planetary configuration, you can hardly stay at home and read a book. You need to get out and about, and what's more, to go somewhere you find very inspiring. Perhaps you could hit the dance floor somewhere, go to a meditation meeting or yoga class, or walk along a beautiful beach. It is within this kind of atmosphere that you could encounter some wonderfully romantic moments.", "trabajo": "It will be hard to say \"no\" to anyone or anything. There is an overwhelming exuberance to the day that is keeping you feeling positive and unstoppable. This is a good time to tackle projects that require your strong leadership skills and exuberance."}, "pisces": {"personal": "If you receive a financial windfall, spend it wisely, Virgo. Your tendency might be to buy gifts or treat a crowd to a lavish night on the town. But where is the enduring value? Invested carefully, a small chunk of money can grow into a much larger one, which will give you many more options. Be prudent.", "amor": "You have a lot to be thankful for at the moment, right? You don't think so? Could the reason be that you have been fantasizing about your loved one? Are you playing around with the thoughts inside your head, instead of getting real? You very much want to know the truth, so take action today and find out what the situation really is. This will help a lot.", "trabajo": "Overall you will feel especially strong, setting the stage for tremendous success in the workplace. You are at a particularly high point with no reason to be afraid of falling. If you want to take a step upward, now is the time to do so."}}
