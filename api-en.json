{"libra": {"personal": "It's important to be more sensitive toward other people's feelings today, Taurus. You may feel more vulnerable than usual. You should do what you can to keep from becoming a victim. Realize that harsh words coming your way now could be a reflection of the harsh words that you've dished out in the past. Ultimately, the events of today could be a good learning experience.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "The celestial configuration will help smooth over many cracks in the wall of your relationship, both large and small. If you have been having any trouble, or other people have been causing problems, then it may be best to put it all behind you and create the kind of romantic atmosphere between you that you have wanting to experience for weeks. You can do it - so make it happen!", "trabajo": "Just when one problem seems to subside, another one crops up again. Today's work may be an uphill battle for you and the end is nowhere in sight. Resist your tendency to throw up your arms in defeat. You will succeed if you really try!"}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Why me? You may feel like you ask yourself this question more than anyone else, sagittarius. Your life may seem like an intense roller-coaster ride that never stops. But deep down you realize that you would have it no other way. Take a break from it all today if you can. Communicate your thoughts and feelings. By talking, you will feel much better about the situation.", "amor": "Today's position of the heavenly bodies gives you a chance to reduce the heat and allow your relationship to simmer, rather than being continually on the boil, as it has been of late. This will probably suit you just fine, as you much prefer the placid life, and too much change can feel unbalancing. So just for now relax, think peaceful thoughts and allow yourselves to enjoy a rest.", "trabajo": "Although you may feel like you are losing the war, today you are likely to win an important battle. Persevere and maintain a positive attitude. You can win this one as long as you stay confident in yourself and your abilities. Victory is yours."}, "cancer": {"personal": "People of great power and drive may pop out of the woodwork today. They'll confront you directly and perhaps challenge you in some way. You may be at a climactic point right now, and feel like you're at a junction. Make adjustments now. Realize that change is a key ingredient for growth. Upheaval and action may be necessary.", "amor": "Today you can put on a real magic act. You can spin words the way a magician performs tricks, and make others hear things that you didn't actually say. You can even create a complete tale that sounds plausible enough, but that never happened. But don't be too cavalier about it - your loved one knows you too well. Don't go too far.", "trabajo": "For most of the day you will be feeling on top of your game. Just make sure you don't get too over-confident. When you assert yourself today, you must realize that people who usually go along with what you say might actually snap back with defiance."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Be careful of letting a sour mood ruin your day, scorpio. You may not feel particularly cheerful. This is liable to have a dramatic effect on everyone else. Be aware of the fact that your mood may not be an accurate reflection of reality, even though for the most part your world is centered on your moods and the dramatic swings they go through within one day.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment could give you access to some of your more interesting fantasies, ones that never usually get to see the light of day. If you are looking for someone with whom you can share them, then don't visit any of your usual haunts. Try going to places that are associated with music or art; you are more likely to meet the right person.", "trabajo": "Reorganize and prioritize instead of sitting back and doing nothing. Now is a good time for you to look at your situation from a more relaxed perspective. Insight will come to you that you can certainly make good use of during the upcoming week."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You look gorgeous and feel especially sociable today, aquarius. Don't be surprised if you either host a social event or decide to attend one to which you've been invited. You're always a congenial companion, aquarius, but today more than ever your enthusiasm is high. People will want to enjoy your company. You may also have some interesting information everyone will want to hear.", "amor": "Partners are all set to take you off on the experience of a lifetime. You have a chance to adventure into unknown zones. The current celestial aspect indicates that with this there is a price. Nothing comes free. You may have to commit yourself to something more than a casual relationship; perhaps create a deeper bond. If this is want you want, then go for it.", "trabajo": "Your inventive mind is working overtime today. This is one of those days in which you have the ability to make major breakthroughs in a project you have been working on. You are likely to come up with a brilliant idea worthy of a patent."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Your financial picture continues to improve. At some point during the day, taurus, you might have the feeling that you aren't working hard enough to keep up your current forward motion, and you might worry. This could be a good motivator, but you don't need to push yourself much harder than you are now. You're on a roll and it's likely to continue. Keep moving, but pace yourself.", "amor": "Today you may find it rather difficult to broach a certain subject with someone very close to you. The celestial energy indicates that there seems to be a barrier there on both sides that does not make this easy. However much effort you have to expend, it will be worth it. It is always worth trying to reach out and make amends. Don't leave it too long.", "trabajo": "You have been riding a wave of good luck and now it is time to pay the piper. Give credit to those who have helped you along the way. Make sure you recognize others for their hard work and solid advice, which has helped you get where you are today."}, "leo": {"personal": "Some kind of settlement, grant, or bonus that you've anticipated for a long time may finally show up, leo. This should make your day! You may want to celebrate. A chance to attend a large social gathering might come your way. Have fun! Tonight don't be surprised if vivid dreams - some great, some sad - come your way. Keep a notebook and pen by your bed so you can write them down.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment helps you to feel more mellow and relaxed than you have for some time. If you are going out on a date, then it will probably be a very romantic and memorable occasion. You will be surprised at how easily you are charmed into submission by all the right kinds of attention, but do keep one foot on the ground at least.", "trabajo": "If you aren't doing your job with passion, then why do it? Today is one of those days in which you should feel inspired to work harder than usual. If you aren't, then maybe you should consider finding new work. Your happiness depends on it."}, "virgo": {"personal": "You may feel extra passionate today, virgo, so don't be surprised if you take things to extremes even more than usual. There's an aggression within you that's working to help keep you in control of every situation. Remember that you must be prepared to receive whatever you dish out. There's a warring instinct in everyone that's likely to emerge on a day like this.", "amor": "Being a rather gentle and soulful person, you may find today a little boisterous. But it does also give you the courage to strike up a conversation with someone who has fascinated you for a while. While it may not be love at first sight, you will find that you have so much in common that you feel like you have always known each other.", "trabajo": "Someone's bitter and rather jaded attitude may be raining on your parade today. This person is likely to tell you how to run your show - and probably how to run your life as well. Don't even give this person the time of day. Tune him or her out."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Bring more of your feelings into the open today, Aries. Don't be so paranoid about what other people think. At times you may feel as if you're in some sort of spy movie with you playing the lead role. The people around you are other players in the game, and you may feel that sometimes they can't be trusted. Maybe they're working for the enemy. It's time to dismiss these thoughts from your mind.", "amor": "Don't let certain dazzling attributes blind you to the reality of someone that you have recently become involved with. The planetary alignment means that you may not be seeing the whole truth about them, and certainly should not make any snap decisions about the way your relationship should progress in the near future. Be prepared to find out what they are really made of first.", "trabajo": "Take hold of a situation that is going nowhere. You may notice that there is stagnation in your workplace thanks to someone's inability to make up his or her mind about a specific issue. This is your time to step in and flex your muscles."}, "gemini": {"personal": "A debate over a controversial subject involving politics or social issues could take place today, gemini. You might find the subject fascinating and learn a lot, but you'll be less comfortable when the conversation changes from a discussion to a quarrel. At that point, you may want to walk away. You're too sensitive, so don't worry about being rude.", "amor": "It is surprising just how bowled over you can be, especially when you think you have understood someone, only to find that you know nothing about them whatsoever. Today your dearest one may suddenly announce something that shocks you. A whole new part of their being is revealed. They may have been wanting to tell you all along, and finally decided to be honest.", "trabajo": "The formula for success is very unclear to you right now. There are conflicting messages everywhere you turn. The key now is for you to simply follow your heart. Do what you love to do and you will automatically achieve the success you desire."}, "aries": {"personal": "Don't downplay your abilities now, Virgo. You're on the brink of greatness, so act like it. Things should go quite well if you let them. Don't clog up the works by thinking that you're unworthy of the good luck that is sure to come your way. If things don't work out exactly the way you want them to, take it as a sign that the situation wasn't right for you anyway.", "amor": "Don't allow your adherence to a routine to stop you from going out on a limb and deciding to do something spontaneous for once. The current planetary energy seems to want to interfere in your daily habits, but only so that the cosmos can offer you a gift of love. If you get an intuition to go somewhere or do something different, then for goodness sake, go for it!", "trabajo": "Be careful of someone who pulls out a great deal of fancy jargon in the workplace today. Most likely, this person is full of tremendous hot air and nothing else. He or she will try to manipulate you in some way, so be careful. Don't be fooled."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Do you have a desire to take a trip far from where you live, pisces? Would you like to live in Europe or Asia? These are desires that you may have at the moment because you're in the process of widening your field of possibilities. See if you can seriously set up a project of this kind. People will be confident in your solidity at the moment.", "amor": "Even though you are usually an authority, you often mistrust others in authority because you wonder about their motives, understanding only too well your own. There is a strong indication now that your latest romantic fling may also be something of an authority, but this time it is on matters of the heart rather than anything else. You can relax knowing you are truly loved and needed.", "trabajo": "Decisions made during the past three weeks need to be reviewed. If they have been difficult to manage or finalize, business deals and negotiations are back on track. Now you need to rebuild and reorganize with fresh eyes and a clearer perspective."}}
