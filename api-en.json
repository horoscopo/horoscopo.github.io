{"libra": {"personal": "Some misunderstandings could cause confusion in the home, Leo. Your intuition and insight should defuse the situation, especially since you're more diplomatic than usual. You could also have an artistic inspiration, perhaps a new project that could be very important to you. It could be important to your career or it could open up new opportunities for you.", "amor": "Paranoia may be rife today. For everything that seems so certain, there is the feeling that something else is being kept a secret. Both you and your sugar honey need to tackle this today, before it escalates. Talking may help to relieve the tension, and give both of you the chance to explain what is really going on, which may make things easier.", "trabajo": "Deep down, a lack of self-confidence is keeping you from reaching your highest potential. Perhaps a long time ago, someone made you feel like you were not fit to accomplish anything noteworthy. Banish these thoughts from your mind. They are untrue."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Tempers could be on edge in conversations between you and some of your close friends, Aquarius. Even you, who are usually very laid back and easygoing, might be tempted to snap at people. There's tension in the air and nerves are strained. Control the urge to lash out if someone says something insulting or otherwise inappropriate. You won't want today's stress to affect tomorrow.", "amor": "It is a great to idea to entertain at home today and invite around a few friends with whom you feel really comfortable. There is the possibility of getting closer to someone you have known from the past in quite a positive way. The day's planetary configuration indicates that you will need to be quite firm about your intentions. In this instance false modesty does no favors.", "trabajo": "Don't get bogged down in your emotions. Your mood may be quite sour but your thinking is clear. Don't let your feelings distract you from the important analytical work that you are doing. Stay focused, and you can accomplish a great deal."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Take charge of your life, Pisces. The more action you take, the more alive you will feel. Maybe you will decide to have a career on the stage. This is the kind of day when you need more variety than usual. Bright and happy people will catch your eye. Jump on the fast track. You're ready.", "amor": "The atmosphere is one of joy and bonhomie today, thanks to the planetary configuration. It would be a good plan to spend the day out with your loved one, or enjoying yourself with other friends. The atmosphere is just too good to be alone, and is a wonderful time for a party or other celebration. The music and wine may flow, but you'll find a way to cope.", "trabajo": "Stand your ground against those who are bullying you. When push comes to shove, you have the correct facts, and you know it. The people on the other side of the fence are simply full of hot air. Don't get overwhelmed by their overbearing presence."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "There may be a battle between old and new in your world today, Scorpio. A reserved and old-fashioned perspective has a strong hold on the prevailing sentiment. This feeling is likely going to hit you square in the face as you lean toward the unconventional and more revolutionary approach to life. See what sort of past lessons you can learn from as you build the future.", "amor": "You and your loved one may need to work out in fine detail just how you are going to approach a certain project you have decided to undertake together. Both of you need to have your feet firmly on the ground, rather than your heads in the air, in order to be able to proceed in the most efficient and progressive way.", "trabajo": "You are good at the idea end of things, but now is the time to deal with the reality end of things. It is essential that you are practical and stable so that you can actually manifest the dreams that you have been dreaming for so long."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Something or someone may urge you to make a major move, Cancer. Be sure you make it in the right direction. Remember that strength lies in numbers. To conquer, people must unite. Factions of people continuing to fight among themselves only aggravate the problem. The key is to accept one another's differences and work together on the larger issues that affect us all.", "amor": "The current planetary aspect indicates that you could have a vested interest in appearing more morose than you actually feel. Do you not have a tendency to manipulate other's feeling through guilt? Do you sometimes withhold affection? Although this often works, today it may backfire, and you may find yourself in a much worse position for having played this game.", "trabajo": "Strong-willed people may stand in your way today. Do your best to avoid them altogether. Their thinking is not along the same lines as yours. Communication with these types of people is only going to complicate matters instead of clarifying them."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Make sure you have an equal amount of give and take in your life, taurus. If someone gives you a compliment today, know how to receive it graciously instead of brushing it off as something meaningless. At the same time, be generous with your compliments to others.

Avoid any major confrontations by becoming part of the solution, not the problem."}, "leo": {"personal": "You're energetic and enthusiastic today, Libra, and those around you respond favorably. It seems everyone wants to be in your orbit. Work at home and the office goes quickly and smoothly. Because you have so much energy, why not take on a new project? Normally this would send you over the edge, but today you feel you could take on anything. Go for it.", "amor": "Today you can put on a real magic act. You can spin words the way a magician performs tricks, and make others hear things that you didn't actually say. You can even create a complete tale that sounds plausible enough, but that never happened. But don't be too cavalier about ityour loved one knows you too well. Don't go too far.", "trabajo": "As you soar to greater and greater heights intellectually, you find that the people around you are bringing you down in some way. You are changing, but they are not.

Lift your chin and get going. You will be glad you did.", "amor": "This may be a time when you feel it is not right for you to settle back in a steady relationship with anyone, as you have been deeply involved for too long now.

Yes, Virgo, it's time for you to choose a hobby.", "amor": "You will begin to experience a sense of relief as someone finally comes out of the closet in terms of how they feel. Within the office environment, you may have put their strange behavior down to a number of things, but not to the fact that they were trying to hide their emotions. They now feel they can cope with the consequences of admitting the truth.", "trabajo": "If you want something to happen, you need to speak up. Others are very mentally oriented today and they aren't going to sense things automatically the way you can. Be clear and direct in your communication with others. This is the only way."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Don't downplay your abilities now, Virgo. You're on the brink of greatness, so act like it. Things should go quite well if you let them. Don't clog up the works by thinking that you're unworthy of the good luck that is sure to come your way. If things don't work out exactly the way you want them to, take it as a sign that the situation wasn't right for you anyway.", "amor": "Love is very subtle, gentle, and romantic today. This is not your usual style, which tends to be more forthright and unmistakable in its expression.

And if you don't give away all your secrets at once, you will be in good position to score.", "trabajo": "People aren't afraid to give you their two cents today even if you did not ask for it. As these opinions fly at you, you are likely to get more and more confused.

It may feel like you've reached gridlock and your choices are limited. You can no longer get a solid handle on things. Instead of trying to make a move now, you may have to wait until the dust settles and you can see clearly again. Let the situation release before you add any more friction.", "amor": " \nOthers may wonder about your detached outlook. It is the effect of the planetary alignment that is making you draw back from a certain emotional relationship. You are appraising the situation in your own way and your own time, and do not intend to be hurried by anyone into making a move before you are ready. Once you have obtained the right perspective, you will be back.", "trabajo": "Team up with someone in the workplace instead of trying to do everything by yourself.
