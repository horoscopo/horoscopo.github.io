Trust yourself to make these spontaneous decisions instead of spending hours deliberating."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You may sense a bit of conflict in your world today, especially when it comes to emotions, Virgo.

Expect a lot of comings and goings, plus an impromptu party or two. Meditation and contemplation could provide inspiration for new projects, and you might spend some time writing down ideas and brainstorming ways to approach them.", "amor": "Whatever opinions you may hold, you can't escape the fact that everything is extremely changeable. Where your deepest bonds and relationships are concerned, you may find that the mood is one of conflict. It is unlikely that you will be able to resolve this without having to compromise in some respect. But are you willing to do so? Or do you merely wish to stake your claim?", "trabajo": "The roller coaster ride never comes to an end, no matter how hard you try to get off.
