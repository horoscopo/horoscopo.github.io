{"libra": {"personal": "This is an important day to make valuable connections, libra. You will be engaged in fast-paced, witty conversations and debates from which you can learn a great deal. You're good at seeing both sides of an issue. The problem is that this can lead to indecisiveness and an inability to commit. Choose a path and stick to it.", "amor": "You may have to tackle something today that you haven't been looking forward to. It is time to set the record straight concerning a past relationship that is still lingering on in some respect. You will have to speak to the person in question, and make your boundaries clear. Tell them what you will and will not tolerate. Then all will be well.", "trabajo": "Your strong will is usually very useful in obtaining facts and getting to the heart of any situation. Today, however, you need to take a more relaxed approach. Be gentle and caring instead of invasive towards people in order to obtain information."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Maintaining equilibrium may not be the easiest task today, but if anyone can do it, you can, sagittarius. Strong opinions from others could crop up to challenge you. You have a great deal of ammunition in your arsenal. You can learn quite a bit by accepting this challenge and engaging in a heated debate. Have faith in yourself.", "amor": "Partners may seem to be going through some kind of phase you have never seen before, but then perhaps this holds true for you as well. The aspect at play is encouraging the mad, bad, and very different to emerge. You may decide to go somewhere completely new and forego old haunts. Try something which really feeds that element of excitement in you and you will both have quite an unforgettable day.", "trabajo": "An extremely favorable trend starts for you today, in which you have the ability to make a significant amount of money. Ask for a raise in the next three weeks. Seek employment that offers a higher salary. You deserve more - so go for it."}, "cancer": {"personal": "It's important to turn your attention to more spiritual matters now, Pisces. Consider enrolling in a yoga class that combines meditation with the physical practice. It's vital to link your mind, body, and soul together. The more you can integrate these three parts of your being, the healthier you will feel. A high-energy dance class would also be a good way to achieve this goal.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "There is a rather hysterical touch to romance today. Whatever the status of your relationship, something seems incredibly funny. It may not be anything but an attack of the giggles. As long as your sweetest love is not too sensitive and therefore liable to be hurt, you can just enjoy this mirthful time and perhaps take in a comedy show whilst you're at it.", "trabajo": "Your point of view will be tested by someone who has a great deal of power behind his or her words. Just because this person talks loudly doesn't mean that he or she knows exactly what he or she is talking about. Be strong and do not waver."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Are you picking up on some unsettling feelings from a friend who lives far away, scorpio? You may wonder if there's something wrong in this person's life. Perhaps you'd better give your friend a call. You'll probably find out that whatever is troubling him or her is minor and nothing that can't be dealt with. Anyway, it will be good to catch up!", "amor": "Today may present a tug-of-war or conflict over the division between career and partnership issues. Your public and social image could be causing a problem with your loved one. This can be overcome by just talking it through, and also by genuinely taking the time to listen to each other. All it needs is the right perspective, and understanding will prevail.", "trabajo": "Today marks the start of a four-week cycle in which you will be either reaping the rewards or realizing your failures. This is a very climactic period for you, so get ready for major evaluation and change."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You may be trying to cling to something that doesn't want to sit still, aquarius. It's like trying to grab a wet fish. The more tightly you   squeeze it, the likelier it is to slip out of your grasp. The trick is to be more strategic and less frantic. You also might consider letting the fish go. It isn't yours anyway.", "amor": "You could be the center of attention today. This brings you and your partner ever more close together, as you genuinely have so much in common. To make the day complete, get out and meet up with friends who inspire laughter and a sense of humor. Just don't over-indulge and drink too much, or else you really will have everyone staring at you!", "trabajo": "Your intentions are in the right place, but you don't seem to be communicating your thoughts very well. As a result, other people are misinterpreting you. Don't be afraid to spell things out in a clear and concrete manner. Take extra time if needed."}, "taurus": {"personal": "This is going to be a good time to get a global view of things, taurus. Take full advantage of the current planetary aspects by reading some books on spirituality or travel. If you desire to go on a long voyage, don't be surprised if your job sends you on an adventure, even if it isn't part of your job routine. Don't hesitate! Go breathe in some fresh air in a new place!", "amor": "The energy of the day brings about a radical change in an important relationship. No matter how much you may have tried to put off this moment of reckoning, you may have to place all your cards on the table. In doing so you may very well end one chapter in your partner (current or prospective)ship; but a new one will dawn that will more certainly reflect your changing needs and desires.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "Instead of trying to explain to people why you are an important asset in the workplace, show them. You will find that communication with others is a bit off for you, but other people will be able to relate to your work quite well. Creativity is key."}, "leo": {"personal": "Set aside some time today explicitly for you, leo. Unexpected events are likely to pop up and cause a stir in your emotions. Giving yourself personal space to digest and deal with these events will help keep you from suppressing your reaction to them. Make sure you have your internal maelstrom of thoughts settled before you get tangled up in others' affairs.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment could make you see someone special in a different light. This is likely to be a wholly positive experience, as you may not have really appreciated them for the wonderful being they truly are, having already placed them in a certain pigeonhole. Your experience with them today will enable you to really find out how lucky you are to have this chance to know them better.", "trabajo": "You are frustrated by the doors closing in your face, but don't be. These are messages from the universe steering you in the right direction. Some things are not meant to be - accept this and move on. The right door will open at the right time."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Latch on to the expansiveness that comes when you connect with others in a social arena, virgo. Communication is a key aspect of the day. If you go with the flow you will land exactly where you need to be. Take the adventurous route and skip around from one thing to another. There's no need to pin yourself down to one route or way of doing things.", "amor": "The planetary configuration today brings a more serious outlook on your relationships and on your ability to express yourself. You may feel unusually insecure about your appearance and about your feelings for someone. It is best, though, not to hide away, but to talk about how you feel. Find out how your loved one really sees you. The reality will probably cheer you up no end.", "trabajo": "Someone with a more traditional view of how things should work is creating a great deal of difficulty for you today. You want to take the lead and expand and move forward creatively while this person wants you to put on the brakes. Find a compromise."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "A miscommunication with a business or romantic partner might cause some ruffled feathers today, capricorn. You can divert this by explaining the facts clearly whenever you give information. Make sure your partner understands what you're saying before they go and act on it! For your own part, don't be shy about asking what someone means. Remember, it's better to ask a stupid question than make a dumb mistake!", "amor": "Today's astral energy may mean that someone decides to take the first step toward getting to know you much more deeply and intimately. They may ask you out to dinner, or out to a show, but it is not so much where you both go that counts, but the magic that seems to run throughout the occasion. You will both be thrilled to have gotten together at last.", "trabajo": "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you applies to the workplace as well - especially today. Be careful of directing your negative attitude towards others. You will say something you regret if you are not careful with your words today."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Plans to get together with a close friend or romantic partner might go awry due to circumstances beyond your control, Taurus. Sudden events could necessitate being out of touch. You might have to face delays when you're trying to make arrangements. Don't give up - you will reach your goal but just a little later than you'd hoped. Accept things as they are and change your schedule. These things happen.", "amor": "The alignment of the planets may mean you feel much more enthusiastic about a relationship that you have been complacent about recently. There is a lot of extra energy around that makes you more forthright and outspoken than usual, and also more insistent on getting your own needs met. This will enable you to play a more active role in the future - which makes life much more fun.", "trabajo": "Think about what you can bring to the workplace today instead of what you can take away from it. Share your knowledge and your inspiration instead of forcibly sucking other people of theirs. What you give will automatically come back to you tenfold."}, "aries": {"personal": "Some vivid dreams could shed light on something you've been trying to find, aries. This could be a lost object or an obscure piece of information. Whatever it is, you might wake up with some new ideas on where to look for it. Chances are it's hidden in an obvious place full of similar things. Don't hesitate because of the unorthodox source of your insight.", "amor": "", "trabajo": "Someone in your workplace who has been around a while is likely to direct a great deal of information your way. Take this information with a grain of salt. Other people are strictly opposed to this person's viewpoint. Consider both sets of ideas."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Your values might be under attack. Perhaps someone connected with your job is doing things that seem unethical and you don't want to be associated with him or her. Whatever the situation, dealing with it may be too difficult. You might even consider leaving your field. Think carefully first! Whatever you decide, you'll want to be sure that it's right for you.", "amor": "Perhaps it is a lack of vision by you or your partner (current or prospective) that creates an emotional problem. The current astral configuration implies that due to a barrier that seems to have developed between you, you are finding it more difficult to communicate in general. One of you needs to get the ball rolling and just start that conversation so the situation can be healed.", "trabajo": "Difficult relations with others will ease, since today marks the start of a three-week cycle in which you will feel a stronger connection with your co-workers. Relating to these people will be much easier than it has been during the recent past."}}
