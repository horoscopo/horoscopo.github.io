{"libra": {"personal": "Some rather shocking information could affect your current living situation and cause some upset in your household today, libra. This might cause a lot of worry, although the situation probably isn't as dire as it seems. Calm everyone down and view the situation objectively. It's better to find solutions than to become angry.", "amor": "The planetary alignment indicates that if you can recover your sense of humor, you may be able to put new life into that hibernating heap, otherwise known as your major relationship. If you persist in seeing it as a dead end, it will be. If, however, you can smile or even laugh, realizing it's not so bad after all, you may be able to resuscitate it.", "trabajo": "Your overall mood is quite good, but communication with others seems to be off. You are dancing around the issues instead of getting to the heart of them. Instead you should penetrate straight to the bull's-eye. You will be commended for doing so."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You might be unfocused and confused about which way to go, sagittarius. Your baffled look isn't giving others much confidence in your ability to make a good decision. Don't feel obliged to stay in an unhealthy situation. It may be time to let go and break some ties to things that are no longer working for you. Feel good about extracting yourself from old habits.", "amor": "Your date this evening may not go entirely according to plan, but it won't be boring. Today's celestial energy encourages you to discover each other's intellectual preferences before you turn to more passionate matters. If you both have the same beliefs and ideals, then everything else will fall into place. If there is no meeting of minds, then no matter how hard you try, it may not last.", "trabajo": "If something is working smoothly, let it be. There is no sense trying to disrupt the flow when everything seems to be working together just fine. Offer your two cents when it is asked of you. Otherwise, keep your opinions to yourself."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Now is the perfect time to say something you've been meaning to say for quite a while, cancer. Get it out in the open. Keeping it inside is only eating away at your internal mechanisms. Stop worrying about the consequences and make the move. Today is a day to be bold and aggressive. Other people might respond similarly, so if you dish it out, be sure you can take it.", "amor": "There is a warm and positive atmosphere around that is perfect for improving the current state of your love life. The planetary energy enables you to get to know a certain person and to make quite a pleasant impression. Although you may not find yourself embroiled in a passionate relationship by this evening, you will certainly have made a very rewarding beginning. Things are looking up!", "trabajo": "Put your strong ideas aside today and be open to the people around you. If you get too caught up in only one way of thinking, then you are likely to miss out on a very valuable point. Let go of the preconceived notion that your way is the only way."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Your flamboyant approach may not get as much attention today as you'd like, scorpio. Don't push yourself to achieve something that isn't working. By insisting that something should be done your way, you'll only create enemies and bottlenecks in whatever task you're trying to accomplish. A thoughtful, conscious, reserved approach is going to win today.", "amor": "Today's astral configuration may imply that you have to resort to using shock tactics to get yourself noticed by someone special. As you are a fairly gentle and placid person, and dislike making a fuss about anything, this has to be a radical gesture; and to be honest, you must also be severely in love to even be contemplating this next step. But sometimes needs must!\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "A little bit of effort will go a long way for you at this time. Don't underestimate your power to accomplish what is most important to you with regard to your career. Circumstances around you are in your favor so take advantage of this favorable time."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "A surprising phone call might come today from a close friend or business or romantic partner, aquarius. This person might have encountered an unexpected upset and need to concentrate on getting it together again. An offer to help might meet with scant enthusiasm, as this person may prefer to take care of things alone. The trick is to be supportive and not take on the troubles as your own.", "amor": "Any kind of social gathering you attend will offer wonderful opportunities to meet people who are in the kinds of circles that you have long wished to be involved in. The planetary energy encourages you to meet and mingle, and to home in on anyone who may be of help. One person, though, will find YOU particularly helpful, and will certainly want your number in their book.", "trabajo": "Your aggressive tendencies may get you in trouble among your co-workers and even your employer, so be careful. You are better off lying low than actively trying to push the buttons or rattling the cages of others who are simply not in the mood."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Today you may be inspired to have a little fun with your looks, taurus. You may wish to change your haircut or experiment with different colors or styles of clothing. It would be fun to get out of your routine, even if it just means donning funky sunglasses or bright Hawaiian patterns. You will feel lighter and more flirtatious.", "amor": "There is conversation; and then there is Conversation. The atmosphere of the day makes you very aware of how speech can be used to create a wonderful deep and caring bond, or equally, to break one in an instant. If you have something to say to your sweetness today, then choose your words carefully. If you can't speak in person, write a wonderful letter expressing how you feel.", "trabajo": "Someone is trying to convince you to jump aboard his or her train. Use caution here. What is good for that person is not necessarily good for you. This person has great enthusiasm about his or her situation, but that doesn't mean you need to join in."}, "leo": {"personal": "Today could provide an interesting opportunity to show your assets in a professional setting. People will be impressed by your personality and may even offer you a new job or exciting business proposal.

Whatever your dearest one gets up to is totally cute with you. Expect to see some dire modes of behavior; no matter, you'll just laugh it off as sweet. Anything puts you in a romantic mood, which could either be great or make life difficult.", "trabajo": "You have an overlying feeling that everyone else's business is your responsibility. You instinctively want to have your fingers in many different pies. Be careful of crossing the line from helpful advice into hurtful gossip or harsh judgment.\n \n \n \n "}, "virgo": {"personal": "Your emotions may be a bit erratic. It may be hard for you to focus on anything today, virgo. Things continue to shift from one topic to the next with little resolution. Others aren't apt to be very sympathetic to your feelings, so don't expect it. You will only set yourself up for disappointment. It's a better day to focus on your head rather than your heart.", "amor": "Socially this is a wonderful day, as you may get to meet a whole new crowd of people who are exciting, fascinating, and certainly worth getting to know. The planetary alignment encourages you to share your feelings where appropriate, but not to get too carried away by ardent promises, as things may appear slightly different tomorrow. Not much, but possibly just a little - so be sensible!", "trabajo": "Others around you are validating you for your hard work and conscious, meticulous efforts. This positive feedback sure feels good, and it should. You have earned it. Today you are feeling so good that you are even willing to go a step further."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "The train is headed out, so you'd better hop on, capricorn. People won't be too sympathetic to your emotional sob story today, so keep it quiet. Whining will most certainly get you kicked off the train altogether. The energy of today is teaching you to toughen up. Don't take it personally, but realize that there are important lessons to learn. One is to know when to be silent and obedient.", "amor": "If you are dating anyone new tonight, then you may be in for a surprise. The day's planetary aspect makes this an occasion you cannot fail to remember. If you have been used to quiet manners, you are in for a shock. This one is wild, undisciplined, and will not do what you ask, but exactly what they feel like. You will probably have a truly fabulous time anyway.", "trabajo": "You will get the feeling that others are not playing by the rules today. Your instincts are correct. Someone is taking a rather immature approach. He or she is bending the rules in order to get ahead. Don't be afraid to alert your superiors of this."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Your emotions and fantasies are strongly tied today, gemini. Let your feelings revel in a surreal state. Let your daydreams filter into your decisions. You might feel electricity in the air, so go with it. There's a great deal of creative energy available to you that's extremely potent. This energy has an activating effect that will help you get off the couch.", "amor": "The world revolves around words and ideas, and without them nothing much would happen. Today you have some ideas about that special person in your life, but don't know if they are true or not. The only way to find out is to ask, although even this can be misleading. Try and get to the root of what is bothering you.", "trabajo": "Volunteer to take on an extra task today.

Doing so will put you in good favor with your superiors and will lead to big opportunities down the road."}, "aries": {"personal": "You may have a very busy day ahead, but you might not be able to concentrate. Too many issues could churn up from the past. Old emotional traumas, money problems from years ago that still haunt you, even past dreams could be on your mind. Don't fight it. This is a healing process. Clear the psychic space to make way for more positive input.", "amor": "You may enjoy finding out all those secrets about your lover today. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by having that much-needed and nosey conversation. What you find out may not be entirely to your liking, but you asked for it, so who can you blame? But rest assured that your presence is greatly appreciated at the moment.", "trabajo": "Try not to get sucked into other people's dramas.

There's also room for others, so let more people on board.", "amor": "Today's astral configuration makes your love life really stand out today. Truly it is exceptionalbecause you will discover that someone you thought was a friend is potentially far more than this, but neither of you had realized just how deep the bond between you really was. An occasion you both attend brings out your deeper feelings, which is both exciting and a little nerve-wracking, as well.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "You can be more productive today than normal. Your mind is much more centered and focused, helping you to channel your energy into one thing instead of millions. This is your secret to success today.
