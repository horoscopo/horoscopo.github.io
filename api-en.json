{"libra": {"personal": "Don't be surprised if someone rubs you the wrong way today, Leo. It's likely that pressure has been building in other people's minds for quite some time. They might have been afraid to share their feelings before simply because they were too intimidated to say anything that might cross you. The molten lava has finally gotten hot enough and the volcano is about to erupt.", "amor": "You may do something today that you have been waiting to do for a very long time. It is a day of revolution, and you intend your love life to be revolutionized in a big way. No half measures; no unfulfilled intentions. The time you have been waiting for is beckoning - put on your glad rags and be the best you've ever been."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Recent overindulgence may have you to feel a bit under the weather this morning, sagittarius. Avoid coffee and other stimulants. Try to sleep in if you can. Too much stress in your life certainly isn't helping. This malaise could pass by noon, but if you've been doing this a lot lately, you need to ask yourself why and find a way to quit doing it.", "amor": "Today's planetary alignment means that a conversation could lead to a very interesting romantic situation, if you can be laid-back and relaxed enough to allow this - and also providing this is what you really do want. Perhaps you should get into the right frame of mind and body by releasing all tensions within you before you even start the day. Don't miss this chance."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You may feel a little out of sorts today, Leo. Perhaps you indulged a bit too much last night. However, some exciting phone calls at midday might perk you up, perhaps good news from a friend or colleague. A change in your financial state is definitely indicated, as is the resulting boost to your self-esteem. All looks wonderful for you in the months to come!", "amor": "You can't just shut someone out of your life because you don't like the way they entered in the first place. Similarly, you can't just decide to end a relationship because of one particularly bad day, or because of a single attitude problem. You will need to have faith in someone who may not have merited faith. If you can do this, a very promising change will occur."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Fire up your energy today, Capricorn, and demonstrate your power to conquer. Create a bonfire of activity that gives off a great deal of heat to the people around you. Some might not be able to stand too close now. Don't worrythat's their problem, not yours. The key for you now is to be yourself. In this way, you will attract those who enjoy the intense heat.", "amor": "Today's position of the heavenly bodies means that a situation between you and your beloved that had become a real and tangible obstacle to true communication may gradually begin to ease and soften. You can begin the process of discovering what went wrong, and how you can both make it right. The key is to be gentle with each other, and to really LISTEN. This will bring healing.\n \n \n \n "}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You should be feeling especially passionate at this time, aquarius, especially regarding partnerships. Romantic partnerships definitely call for an evening together! Professional and creative partnerships call for a new project that you believe in strongly. Look to events in other states or foreign countries for inspiration. Something begun in places far away could capture your imagination.", "amor": "You may just lap up the atmosphere today, basking in the attention coming your way. It is pretty obvious just how a certain person feels about you. But because you have a few other strings to your bow, you can afford to pick and choose. However, don't leave them dangling for too long as you could well miss out on an excellent opportunity."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Add a bit of spark to your day, Sagittarius. Get yourself into gear. It might feel like there's a great deal of anticipation in the air, but don't get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the day you've been given, and make sure you use every minute to its fullest potential. Small annoyances may turn into large headaches unless you maintain an honest mind and neutral standpoint.", "amor": "If you have been feeling particularly hurt or rejected by someone from long ago whom you have not been able to forget, then take heart from today's planetary alignment. It will begin to defrost your heart and melt away the pain. A particularly pleasant meeting may just inspire you to start thinking of the future instead of the past, and none too soon!"}, "leo": {"personal": "You usually like to think of yourself as being a scientific, logical person, Scorpio, but today you may think more like a mystic. Your intuition is more active than usual, and you might come up with the same words as someone close to you. You might also feeling especially inspired to work in an innovative way. Use your intuition and go for it!\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "Foreign shores may be beckoning you for a variety of reasons. Either you are thinking of moving, or you have made a connection with someone from another country that is having a very profound effect on your life. With the celestial energy at play, another major step today may well bring you nearer to your goal of meeting. Be open to interesting opportunities that could enable this."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Have you recently lost some faith in the future, virgo? Isn't it time to do something about it, especially where your personal life is concerned? You could find the answers to these questions if you'd take a second look at the quality of your close relationships. Who knows? Love might give you back your enthusiasm for life.", "amor": "Today's planetary configuration may bring up some old fears from the past that seem to haunt your current relationship. There may not be any tangible reason why you feel as you do, but you will need to be wary of projecting past worries onto a current dilemma that may not have any link. It would not be a good idea to make any big decisions right now."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Whatever you didn't get done yesterday, capricorn, you need to finish today. Discipline and attention to the sand slipping through the hourglass are the journey's themes. The more you're able to accomplish, the better you'll feel. Stagnant energy is a sign that it's time to get moving. Don't waste a moment waiting for someone else to come up with a solution. Take the initiative.", "amor": "You may not feel in the mood for any nonsense as far as a loved one is concerned. The current astral energy is goading you into saying something about an issue that has had you on tenterhooks for some time. You have probably been brooding over this for a while and could suddenly feel as though you are about to explode. Just don't make a fool of yourself."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Expand your mind to its furthest reaches today, gemini. There's an incredible opportunity opening up in which you can make great strides in a creative realm. Follow the music today. Pick up an instrument, go to the record store, or listen to a live band. Let the artist within you have room to shine. Shoot for a goal and don't stop until you reach it.", "amor": "Love is intense right now. But in order to take advantage of this, you may need to change your attitude a little. You and your loved one may be getting along fine, but if that magic spark has been flickering recently, then take them out to dinner and let them know you still care as much, if not more, than ever."}, "aries": {"personal": "You may be faced with a difficult choice today in a particular area of your life, Scorpio. It's likely the dilemma stems from a desire to follow your creative, imaginative spirit, while another part of you feels held down to things more practical and grounded. See what you can do to combine the two forces and fuse them into one powerful manifestation.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "You will perhaps find today a little dry for your taste. The celestial energy means that you have every chance of spending the day in deep conversation, rather than enjoying the finer and subtler qualities of feeling and the delicacies of love. The most you can hope for is to try and persuade your loved one to take you to a romantic movie on the grounds that you can review it - second hand is better than nothing at all."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Today you might be eagerly awaiting a phone call that never seems to come from a current or potential romantic partner, pisces. This could awaken your insecurity and cause you to think the worst. You should be relieved when the call finally comes, probably in midafternoon. Relax, hang in there, and keep busy!", "amor": "The day's planetary configuration indicates that this could be a very sociable day, with friends providing a lot of laughs. You seem to be very popular at the moment, and in your close relationships there is a lot of natural warmth. If you have anything to say, do so today, as this is the right time. Don't hold back; speak about how you feel with complete honesty."}}
