{"libra": {"personal": "The fast-paced frenzy of the day is just what you need to jump-start your brain and get it moving in the right direction, Gemini. Take control of the fire within and keep it strong all day. You'll find that there's a more personal aspect to your thoughts, and you can think more rationally about your emotions. Your heart and your head are working well together.", "amor": "You may find the atmosphere today a little dull compared to the excitement you normally enjoy. You like glamour, glitz, and the feeling of being the center of attention. There is certainly a good energy between you and your loved one, but it is not particularly passionate, but rather more gentle and sedate. Taking the time to listen is very beneficial.", "trabajo": "Team-members in the workplace will give you the boost you need today to get your work to the level it needs to be at. Ask advice from others but don't be afraid to go out on your own. Working independently will be quite rewarding for you today."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You're often preoccupied by other people's lives. Your devotion to others will be appreciated today, Aries. For example, in the family circle, you may have to bandage everyone's little physical or psychological wounds. Don't neglect your energy needs. As you're aware, you need all the strength you can muster.", "amor": "You will enjoy your social engagements today. You may come face-to-face with a person who has some awesomely strange tastes. As you would never let go of a chance to talk to a living freak, you will probably engage this person in conversation. Just don't be surprised by what happens next. Call it love, passionwhatever it is, it's hot!", "trabajo": "You are anxious to start something new today, but you need to be patient. First you must finish up current tasks and half-finished jobs. These projects are closer to completion than you might think. Get them done before you move on to something else."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Acknowledgement for work well done could come your way, Aquarius, as those around you suddenly seem to see you in a new light. In some cases, a touch of fame could result. This could pertain either to your career, personal life, or both. Either way, it boosts your enthusiasm and self-esteem, which should enable you to continue pushing ahead. Enjoy your fame and then aim higher!", "amor": "You have a slightly crude sense of humor and a real horsey laugh. Today may bring this out to full capacity. If your loved one objects (as they have every right to) and threatens to deprive you of all the perks of the relationship, how will you react? If it's by telling another bad joke, then perhaps they should just grin and bear it!", "trabajo": "Someone is popping the bubble that you were living in. It seems that you have been traveling along in your fantasy world and enjoying the ride, but now someone exposes the true reality of the situation. It is time to re-evaluate your position."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "You might feel a great deal of physical power today, Capricorn. If someone asks you to help move a couch, you're likely to be able to pick the whole thing up by yourself. Don't sell yourself short. You have more internal strength than you reveal to others. There's no need to hide it any longer. Make use of this great power.", "amor": "Your partner may be anxious to whisk you away somewhere exotic. The current planetary configuration enables you both to plan a get-away, but do make sure you make it an adventure. You will not appreciate simply lying by a pool, sipping cocktails, and getting sunburnt. You need to listen to the call of the wild in your soul, and do something about it, preferably together.", "trabajo": "Someone you have been relying on for information is suddenly changing his or her mind. The facts have changed, and you need to pick up the pieces and put them back together in a new way. Take your time and be patient with the changing circumstances."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "If you've had some problems in your sentimental life during the last few months, Libra, they're probably behind you now. It's a sure bet that you've learned something. You've been served the same dish for years and now it seems you've finally had enough! Know that from now on you'll be better about not falling into the same old traps.", "amor": "There are days when you can't help worrying about the state of play within your current love affair. Today may make you feel a little suspicious about your loved one's intentions. All kinds of fantasies may be playing through your mind, in which you self-indulgently blow all kinds of signs out of proportion. But it may be best to wait, before you accuse your sugar puff unnecessarily.", "trabajo": "There is a very expansive feeling to the day and whatever idea you have will be multiplied or amplified in some way. This is fine, but make sure you verify your intensions with others before moving forward recklessly. Check in before you proceed."}, "taurus": {"personal": "You may feel especially emotional today, Aries, reacting strongly to just about every image you see, whether it's a war photo or a kitten on a doorstep. Spiritually, you're highly motivated and longing to know more about the world. You might find yourself thinking of making a pilgrimage. If you're serious, make your plans now.", "amor": "One thing you find very hard to cope with is boring routine. Today you may be attracted by someone who seems to break every rule in the book. They may not look like much physically, but you sense a restlessness that you find intriguing. You notice that they have trouble keeping still, and have a well-traveled look. You definitely want to know more.", "trabajo": "Today you will suffer the consequences that happen when you neglect to completely plan out your moves. Most of the time, you rely on your sporadic, haphazard approach to see you through. Today you will see that sometimes this approach falls short."}, "leo": {"personal": "You're at an emotional climax now, Virgo. Things are coming to a critical point. Little issues in your relationships that you've ignored are coming back to haunt you. Someone could be trying to cross you at this time, or maybe it just feels that way. Don't get overly paranoid. The whole world isn't out to get you.", "amor": "This is a day when you could potentially meet up with the kind of person whom you have often dreamt would enter your life, yet never dared hope for. If chance should bring you together, you will find this lover extremely passionate, deeply romantic, and full of feeling and tenderness. They will certainly always let you know how much they care.", "trabajo": "This an extremely favorable time for youa time in which you can make great strides in whatever you are currently working on. You have the tools you need to make great progress. On a day like today you even have the motivation to use them!"}, "virgo": {"personal": "You've never looked better, virgo. Your partner notices, too, and showers you with extra affection and perhaps even an unexpected gift. This should put a smile on your face! At work, you may be given responsibilities beyond your usual job. Take care to do this special assignment well. If you do, other advancements are likely to follow.", "amor": "Perhaps you would rather ignore the day's planetary lineup, which may be forcing you to look rather too closely at certain facts of yourself that you may not be quite ready or able to face up to. Your partner, though, is entirely willing that you should see these things, and will probably go to great lengths to point them out. See what needs truly seeing, and then discard the rest.", "trabajo": "A difficult power struggle will erupt in your place of work today - and most likely, it will not be pretty. Other people are armed and ready to fight. You should be as well. Just make sure you don't get too carried away. Remember that it's just a job."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "There may be power struggles brewing beneath the surface that become evident in your interactions, Gemini. Your first reaction may be to get upset and make your viewpoint even more rigid. It's important that you be more laid back. Accept that other people have different perspectives on the situation. Work with instead of against them. Walk away if others are unreasonable.", "amor": "There is such a subtle yet truly magical atmosphere around today that even you find it hard not to succumb to the heady mood it conveys. This is a day that could bring you face-to-face with the person of your dreamsbut you won't be dreaming. However, you do need to keep a sense of realism, and work at creating a tangible bond between you.", "trabajo": "You will succeed only if you are able to work constructively with traditional values and the structure that is already in place. If you try to resist the current constructs then you will find yourself working against the grain with great difficulty."}, "gemini": {"personal": "The train is headed out, so you'd better hop on, Aquarius. People won't be too sympathetic to your emotional sob story today, so keep it quiet. Whining will most certainly get you kicked off the train altogether. The energy of today is teaching you to toughen up. Don't take it personally, but realize that there are important lessons to learn. One is to know when to be silent and obedient.", "amor": "This is a day that may bring out some strange new traits in your partner. You may have thought you had your sweetie entirely scoped out, and knew them inside out, but you could find that you are way off base. Whether you approve of their latest escapades or not, you may just have to accept that there is more to your loved one than you could possibly have known.", "trabajo": "Even if you are not working today, work is still on your mind. Your brain is in high gear, and this is fine. An idea you have today is worth pursuing. You have reached a new starting point; so feel free to plant some new seeds at this time."}, "aries": {"personal": "There may be doubt about the outcome of a project that means a lot to you. It may involve financial problems or lack the support from others that you require in order to complete it. Your doubts are most likely groundless, Libra, but it doesn't hurt to hedge your bets a little and seek what you need elsewhere. This is likely to be a temporary delay. All signs indicate success.", "amor": "Are you wondering why your love life feels awry? It could be a certain attitude from which your relationship is hanging, as though off a cliff. Something from the past may be haunting you, stopping your present from evolving. It may need a little quiet contemplation to get the right perspective - but it will be very much worth it.", "trabajo": "A missing piece of the puzzle reveals itself and you suddenly discover that you have been barking up the wrong tree. You easily bounce back and re-focus your attention where it needs to be in order to come out of this sticky situation on top."}, "pisces": {"personal": "A group activity, perhaps a festival of some kind, could bring new information and people into your life. You could meet people from all over the world and lifestyles. You might also discover some new products you want to try. This experience could transform you in a profound way, so don't expect to go back to your routine immediately.", "amor": "Could this pass like a ship in the night, or is it the real thing? The day's planetary configuration indicates that it is a good idea to look carefully at any offers before making major decisions. It could turn out to be anything from the romance of the century to simply a wonderful friendship. Don't end up being disappointedtake some time to get really acquainted.", "trabajo": "You may feel alone because of certain ideas and belief systems you hold. The reality is that most of this loneliness is simply your own mental construct. More people agree with you than you think. Open yourself up and you will find this to be true."}}
