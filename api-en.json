Make sure you understand the situation completely before you jump in with both feet.", "amor": "The energy of the day indicates that you certainly have plenty to say for yourself. It also means you have plenty you could say to others. If you have been looking for that special one-to-one relationship, then your come-on lines may become masterpieces of poetic skill and verbal dexterity. Just how many ways can you ask a person to date you? You'd be surprised!", "trabajo": "You are not willing to take any risks and this is fine. You shouldn't. Hold on to what you have, instead of putting it on the line for a chance to gain more. Such risky behavior is likely to backfire. Don't get talked into these kinds of gambles."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Someone or something may intimidate you and make you want to retreat, Taurus. But this person or situation is the very thing you need now in order to do what you have to do. Opportunities are there for you even though they may be disguised. Once you find them you will know. Have confidence that you're ready for the next step in your journey.", "amor": "Whether you are just about to enter into a relationship, or just about to leave one, the day's planetary aspect indicates that this is a great time for discussion on any important issues. It is also a positive time for socializing in general, especially if you are still looking for the romance of the century. Talking to new people is the answer.", "trabajo": "Reorganize and prioritize instead of sitting back and doing nothing. Now is a good time for you to look at your situation from a more relaxed perspective. Insight will come to you that you can certainly make good use of during the upcoming week."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Today may be tough, cancer. Does it seem like nothing fits into place? Are you trying to be someone you're not? If things don't seem to be working out, don't press the issue. You're better off waiting for a time when you feel more confident about who you are and where you're going. Meanwhile, have some tea and relax. Releasing stress can clear some energy for doing other things.", "amor": "What sets out as just a great idea may lead you and your partner into something that deepens your relationship in more ways than you could have possibly conceived. With a little help from the heavens, you have the chance to transform an area of life, paradoxically for someone else, and make their life a little happier. In doing this you will both benefit by drawing even closer together.", "trabajo": "Your motives and your plans will be questionedso make sure you have answers ready. It is important that you are well organized, and most likely, you will be. The energy of the day is facilitating your need to make a long list and stick to it."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Some paperwork might need execution today, Libra. This may be tedious, but it's apt to open new doors for you and pave the way to more success and good fortune.

Explore your options.", "amor": "The current planetary alignment creates a much more stable backdrop for your love life than you may have experienced for some time. You could be getting tired of dashing around, going out on exciting dates, flirting madly at parties and trying to find a partner who will stick you with you for more than five minutes. Today you may meet someone who will, if you don't lapse into boredom.", "trabajo": "                \nTry not to get sidetracked today. Other people may come to you with their \"brilliant\" ideas for your consideration. Most likely, you don't have time for this. You need to concentrate on other things.

It seems like the starting gate has just opened and you're leading the charge. The one thing that could put a damper on the race is your rational mind reminding you that it's also important to stop. Look around and reflect on what's going on around you. Incorporate both energies into your day.", "amor": "Rather than state your case, you may be tempted to avoid conflict by hiding behind a barrier of indifference. The astral energy indicates that although this may feel like the less controversial option, it could actually be making matters worse, as the tension will inevitable continue to build. You don't need to make a big showyou just need to speak honestly and truthfully from the heart.", "trabajo": "You will feel a pressure to lift off from the solid foundation you are on, so that you can escape into the clouds. Inherently, you are hard-wired to resist this and so you fight with all your might to stay grounded. Don't fight. Just let yourself go."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Your adaptive powers are useful in that they give you a high tolerance for uncomfortable situations, Sagittarius. At times, however, this trait may not serve you very effectively. You may end up staying in a difficult relationship or unsatisfying job because you fear something new. Life is short.

You can do no wrong by just being your usual, outlandish self!", "amor": "There is the potential for sudden change within your romantic life at the moment. The current planetary configuration brings things to a head in such a way that a relationship that has grown sour may suddenly end, whereas a romance that has been quietly pollinating may suddenly bloom.

Literally anything can happen.", "trabajo": "You will feel the annoying pull of reality telling you to be more practical with your ideas. Today this is not a bad idea.

You might feel that you'll go crazy if you don't get out for a while. But responsibilities may keep you indoors anyway. It's important to get out.

This should bring some relief, at least for now.", "amor": "You may find yourself in something of a difficult situation today regarding a certain close relationship. This could be causing a problem at home because a distance has developed between you both. It would be worth taking some time out to sort through this issue and bring it to a state of resolution, and then things will begin to happen.", "trabajo": "Your grounded, practical, and concrete plan is being shaken up by something unexpected. There is rigidity in the air that is making it difficult for you to roll with the punches. See the wisdom, not the aggravation in the information that comes."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Today you could be in the public eye in some way. Perhaps you're teaching a class, giving a lecture, or leading a discussion group. Whatever it is, don't be surprised if you alternate between inspired and free-flowing articulation and total mental block. When the latter happens, ask for questions. That'll give them a chance to speak and get your brain going again.", "amor": "Although you prefer to keep an air of mystery about you, today's aspect may mean someone will be very keen to find out as much about you as possible, and may leave no stone unturned in order to do so. Yet even though you both share many fascinating discussions, they get no nearer to understanding what truly makes you tickwhich is just as you like it.", "trabajo": "Gutting a current project and starting completely over may sound like a good idea, but it isn't.

Take it easy, relax, and you'll be your old self again tomorrow.", "amor": "You have many options open to you today, but they all come through conversing with new people.
