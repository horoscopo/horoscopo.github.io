However, it may not be someone else who spills the beans, but you yourself, as you decide that this has now become important enough to share with the world. Although it may be a difficult decision - it will be worth it in the long term.", "trabajo": "When arguments heat up in the workplace, be careful that you don't end up playing on both teams. Others may see you as a backstabber and soon you will lose respect from both sides. Pick one side, the other, or stay out of the fight altogether."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You might be unfocused and confused about which way to go, sagittarius. Your baffled look isn't giving others much confidence in your ability to make a good decision. Don't feel obliged to stay in an unhealthy situation. It may be time to let go and break some ties to things that are no longer working for you. Feel good about extracting yourself from old habits.", "amor": "You may find it difficult to string two sentences together today, despite your wonderful grasp of language and your ability to communicate fluidly. The position of the heavenly bodies somehow reduces your thought patterns to so much smoke. You may feel that you need to think seriously about a current relationship, but in fact it would be best if you didn't. Just allow it to flow for a while.", "trabajo": "Look deeper into a conversation that you have with someone today. There is hidden meaning in their words that you need to tune into. Don't just take things on a surface level. If you do, you will be missing a very important piece of the puzzle."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Keep your eyes open today. Be on the lookout for opportunities and invitations. Don't act too hastily. This is a key time in which life seems to be moving more quickly than ever. Change may be just what you need to foster your growth. Don't just grab the first thing that comes your way. Examine your options closely, make sure you're confident about the situation - then act.", "amor": "You have carte blanche to do whatever you like, with one provision: you must tell the person close to you the truth about an issue that you are feeling a little guilty about. Talking it through at home in a private and comfortable atmosphere will heal the situation. Then you can go forth and enjoy the day.", "trabajo": "Your physical strength is at a peak, giving you great endurance in the workplace.

The situation isn't helped by the fact that you may not be able to reach them by phone or email. You may have to contact mutual friends who can give you the information you need. Circumstances probably aren't all that dire. There's probably nothing to be overly concerned about, but you need to hear this. Keep trying.", "amor": "                \nIf there is one piece of advice that you really need to pay attention to right now, it is, \"Don't promise more than you can deliver.\" The current astral environment may encourage you to go completely over the top in your bid to attract the attention of a certain person.

Your sense of discipline comes in handy as you tackle your work with incredible enthusiasm. Your goals aren't far from your reach. Stay focused and don't get pressured by the ticking clock. Hastiness will lead to careless mistakes. If you're going to do a job, do it right the first time.", "amor": "Make sure that you have your rose-tinted spectacles firmly adjusted at the moment, because you will be looking through them all day.

Your perseverance will inspire others.", "amor": "For you, there is nothing that kills passion so quickly as too much of it.

Taking direction could rub you the wrong way, especially if you're set on doing something different. Communicate your ideas and how you want to approach things rather than let irritation get to you.
