{"libra": {"personal": "It's time to settle down from the rapid-fire activities of the past few days and retreat to a quieter state of mind, libra. Take care of the details you failed to attend to while you were out having fun. Now is the time to turn inward and reflect. Rely on your inner reserves as opposed to your outwardly directed actions. Stay grounded and let your emotions work with your rational side.", "amor": "Friends, partners, and family are in a rebellious mood today, and will not be trying to put on any kind of front or faÃ§ade for your peace of mind. The celestial configuration means that they are upfront, loud, and sassy, and you may wish you could disown them. But you too may need to take a page from their book. Be honest yourself, instead of trying to please everyone.", "trabajo": "Your detective powers will come in handy as you sort through the rhetoric that is coming at you from all angles. Take control of a situation that is floundering because of lack of direction. The energy is there. It just needs to be focused."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Some technological gadgets that you make copious use of may go out of whack today, Gemini. This could prove frustrating for you, but don't vent your frustrations on them. That wouldn't help! Stay calm and call in a professional to fix the problem. Think of the expense as a contribution to your own mental health.", "amor": "The present celestial atmosphere certainly brings one relationship very much alive, even if you thought that it was just about to expire on the rocks. Whatever you both get up to today, expect to find your love for each other growing at an alarming rate. You may even want to treat each other to a very special meal, replete with foods that will heighten your enjoyment. Lucky you!\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "In order to advance in your career, you will need to take some risks on faith. Have a solid base to work from, but don't be afraid to branch outward into the unknown. Let yourself dream and expand instead of sticking only to familiar territory."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Today you may come down from your recent high with a thud. If you feel irritable dealing with everyday chores, you're not alone. Your mood may be exacerbated by a visit from an even grumpier friend. If you're feeling cooped up with the detritus of family life, take a break and go for a long walk to clear your head and raise your spirits. Tomorrow is another day.", "amor": "Today is one in which the whole world of imagination and fantasy are important. The day's planetary configuration indicates that you have access to the world of powerful images. How you use these is up to you. Positive images can get your love life off to a whole new start, and negative ones can make things worse. How are your thoughts making things better or worse between you?", "trabajo": "Dreams of yours that have been tarnished lately will receive a fresh new start today. There is no reason why you can't create the perfect scenario in your workplace. Work toward this perfect scenario instead of being satisfied with \"average.\""}, "scorpio": {"personal": "It can be very easy to get carried away today, Capricorn. You might get caught up in some excitement. You need to use your head on a day like this. Double-check everything and moderate your activities. Keep your limitations in mind. There's nothing saying you can't do whatever it is that catches your eye. Just use caution and keep yourself safe.", "amor": "If you feel that you are swimming in a sea of controversy, perhaps you should consider the alternative. This is to be on dry land, and just not moving at allin other words, stranded. Accept the place where you find yourself, and just get on with sorting out your problems, as this offers the best alternative to what you are consideringwhich is running away.", "trabajo": "You are in good favor with the people around you and others are willing to stand up in your behalf. Go ahead and speak your mind. Your emotional confidence is strong, leading to tremendous support in the workplace. Make your big move now."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You may be undecided about a loved one today, aquarius. Something may urge you to act yet you want to lay low. There's an important next step that you must take now. Carefully think the situation through before you make a move. In fact, this day would best be spent gathering data on the issue. It seems you should wait a bit before actually doing anything about it.", "amor": "There is potential today for fooling around, but given the light, but less-than-lusty planetary energy filling the air, it is not a time when you can expect a great deal of passion. Romance seems to boil down to discussions about many facets of love and even technique, punctuated by a lot of laughter. But when it comes to the real thing, you may have to wait for a more suitable moment.", "trabajo": "If you go with the flow it will be hard for others to pick you out of the crowd. Do something that will make you stand out. Try a dramatic and creative approach. Others will not be able to resist your artistic style when presented tastefully."}, "taurus": {"personal": "You feel as though you've turned a financial and professional corner, Pisces. Recent accomplishments have you feeling energized and on top of the world! You exude confidence. It's a good feeling, isn't it? Members of the opposite sex are especially attracted to you right now. And who could blame them? You're looking great!", "amor": "It seems that whatever you do today has a potent effect on the life of someone close to you. The planetary energy at play brings with it the desire and the ability to forge full speed ahead. Naturally, you would like your partner to be right there with you. But if they are unable to keep up the pace, you may need to be prepared to go the next few steps alone.", "trabajo": "What you think is least likely to happen probably will. When making long-term plans, you must keep in mind that there are hundreds of unexpected variables to account for. Stay flexibleespecially during the next few months."}, "leo": {"personal": "Good news about career success may have your home in an uproar. Visitors, particularly men and young people, could be in and out all day, and warm and loving calls could come periodically. You may want to do some work on your home, perhaps clean, decorate, or even minor repairs, but the interruptions may get in your way. Enjoy the company. You can always do what's necessary tomorrow!", "amor": "You know how painful it is when people close to you seem unapproachable and distant. You yourself can be distant and just that touch off-hand when you fear a reprisal. This is why it is important today to keep your heart in the right place. Don't be filled with paranoia about what seems to be happening, when it may not be what you think at all. We perceive in different ways, and signals can be misleading.", "trabajo": "More than one person might tell you how to do your job today. Listen with only one ear.

You know best."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Don't automatically assume that you can work out all your problems alone, virgo.

We all have problems and issues to deal with. You aren't alone.", "amor": "You may have to tackle something today that you haven't been looking forward to. It is time to set the record straight concerning a past relationship that is still lingering on in some respect. You will have to speak to the person in question, and make your boundaries clear. Tell them what you will and will not tolerate. Then all will be well.", "trabajo": "Unfortunately, you aren't able to make the connections you want to today. People you call are unavailable and your keynote speaker is unable to attend the meeting you scheduled. Accept this and trust that these things have happened for the best."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You may try to explain something with your brain today when the true understanding of the situation comes only through your heart, capricorn. Feel the answer from deep within instead of trying to decipher it. Sink into the mood of the environment instead of trying to break it down into little compartments that you can analyze and categorize. Consider the whole instead of the pieces.", "amor": "A wonderful truly romantic day is dawning. The atmosphere of the day makes it a time for exploring your relationship further. If you are looking for a romantic partner, you may need to tone down your act. It is all well and good to be enthusiastic, but don't overdo it to the extent that your intended one is pushed into a corner, with no escape, until they say \"Yes.\"", "trabajo": "Going with the flow may not be so easyor so obvious.

You can feel the eyes following you as you walk down the street. Enjoy the attention!", "amor": "Life is a little odd today. You have to hold on and not allow any surprises to apparently surprise you. You need to maintain that cool, calm, and detached image that you have so successfully cultured.

Smile, even if you have to grin and bear it.", "trabajo": "No one is going to appreciate a sourpuss so if you have a bad attitude when you wake up this morning, be sure that you leave it at home. Any negativity will be amplified, so you are better off wearing a smile. The day will go much more smoothly."}, "aries": {"personal": "People close to you might be a bit worried about you, Leo. Too much work and socializing might have you feeling less than your usual self, and perhaps even a little feverish and headachy. If so, this is a good day to take time out, stay home, and rest.

Take a break and your body will reward you with greater clarity and concentration.", "amor": "Money can be used for many things, but one of its greatest uses is to make others happy. Today you have the chance to make your lover very happy, especially if you are considering buying something to cheer them up. Make it a present that reflects the spiritual value of the relationship, and which shows them what you value most about them.", "trabajo": "Don't act like the kind of person you think you should be in order to please others.

Other people are opening in up to you in new ways."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Today you may fall in love at first sight. Perhaps with someone you've never met before or an old friend you suddenly see in a new light. You could also learn something wonderful you never knew before about a current partner. However it manifests, today bodes well for romance. Look your best all day. If possible, go out with your partner tonight!", "amor": "Sometimes loving another is easy and fun, and at other times it takes more effort, especially when they are not on their best behavior.
