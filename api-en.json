{"libra": {"personal": "Be more optimistic than usual today, libra. It's important that your intense emotions don't bog you down. You may lose sight of important facts. Maintain a healthy relationship between you and reality. You may find that your head is in the clouds and you're slowly slipping into some netherworld that has nothing to do with you. Don't get thrown off course.", "amor": "You can indulge in your favorite hobby today, which is deep and meaningful conversation. You have an opportunity to talk about your feelings for your lover, but you may also need to talk specifically about an issue from the past that has been haunting both of you. Find the deeper meaning in this, and the day will have been very worthwhile.", "trabajo": "Communication is a key catalyst for progress today. Don't put yourself into a bubble and think that you can do everything without the help of others. Admit that you don't know everything and ask for help when you need it. You'll be glad you did."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Stress and strain could take their toll on you today, sagittarius. Your significant other might be in a foul humor. When the two of you get together, you might want to sit in companionable silence and not say much. Your beloved has had a rough day and is irritated at words and gestures that would be endearing at other times. You may feel a little tense, too. Single? Stay in and indulge in your favorite comforts.", "amor": "It is the unlikely combination of pure genius and a day at the office, as well as an unexpected but seemingly destined event that brings about a meeting that is both very welcome and yet a complete surprise. The day's celestial configuration guarantees a date that will be like no other. You will love every minute of the adventure you are about to embark on.", "trabajo": "An element of deception enters the workplace today so be extra careful of whom you trust and what you trust. Be on the lookout for a well dressed, smiling individual trying to sell you a crazy idea or a new insurance policy. Question the source."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Take pride in your nurturing instincts, cancer. Rescue an injured bird or join a conservation group. Do something to help save the whales. Take a more active role in the preservation of the planet. Become a concerned citizen who regularly speaks out for what you believe in. Don't let other people's political agendas get in the way of your true purpose.", "amor": "Current astral energies could confuse certain issues within a close relationship that had been fairly clear. You both enjoy being together, but may not be able to come to any decisions about how you would like to progress in the future. Don't fret about this now, as this will make matters even more muddy between you, just enjoy what you have today. Tomorrow will take care of itself.", "trabajo": "None of the choices you are presented with today seem especially favorable. Other people may be excited about their new and innovative ideas, but you are not impressed. This is fine. There is nothing that says you need to agree with everyone else."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "You're the missing piece of the puzzle today, scorpio. As a result, people will look to you for answers. The good news is that you'll have them at the ready. Trust yourself. Information and new ideas may be flying around, and you may be called upon to make sense of it all. Don't be afraid to err on the side of the fanciful. This may be exactly the answer needed.", "amor": "You may enjoy a spell of pure popularity today. Your traditional approach to love and romance is greatly appreciated by one person, of whom you have had certain thoughts for some time. They adore your practical approach to relationships, where both parties help each other up the ladder of success by pooling resources and talents. You have a true admirer on your side.", "trabajo": "Other people should know better than to press your buttons today. You are a walking time bomb that could explode at any second. Do your best to funnel this tremendous energy into productive work instead of lashing out in anger at those around you."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Today may start out frustrating, Scorpio. Be prepared! Some equipment might go on the blink and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from your partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This would not only provide an energy outlet but also clear your head.", "amor": "Today you could well have a feeling of having lost out on some level. Perhaps this is not so much what another has done to you, as what you have done to yourself. There may be an issue that has arisen recently about which you have not been true to your beliefs. You may have sold yourself short on some level. Take time to think this through.", "trabajo": "The work you have been doing lately is finally paying off. All the intense discipline that you have had on a project will be met with great recognition today. The ideas that you have been developing are getting out to the people who need to hear them."}, "taurus": {"personal": "This is a great day for you, taurus. You'll find that long-term trends are coming together harmoniously. Connections are being made when you share good times and laughter with close friends and other people. Stick with the things that feel right. You have love and bravery to share with the world, so don't be afraid to go out and conquer. Take action and be strong.", "amor": "The current astral configuration will certainly give you all the powers of conversation that you could possibly need in order to persuade a very desirable person of the fact that you appreciate them deeply. Up until today you may have found yourself tongue-tied, but all of suddenly the verbal floodgates are opened, and you are able to discuss just about anything with flare, confidence, and wit.", "trabajo": "Others will take note of everything you do. They will remember. Even small things you do for othersgetting them a cup of coffee, offering to run a small errand at lunchwill all be appreciated. Do these helpful and generous things with a smile."}, "leo": {"personal": "This planetary energy is going to test your recurring desire to go to the other side of the world or have a ready exit in any relationship. You do this so you won't feel trapped and, above all, so you won't be dependent. This is one of your strengths, Scorpio, but it's also one of your weaknesses. Throughout the next few weeks you will be pushed to involve yourself more intimately with others.", "amor": "Love is very much connected with your career or working life. Perhaps you both work together, or your lover is associated with what you do for a living. The current celestial aspect indicates that you both need some time out from the limelight, and to be alone together. Get away from the rat race and really enjoy each other's company.", "trabajo": "Try not to lose your sense of dignity and integrity in the workplace. It is quite possible that you lose your grounding thanks to the pressure of office politics. Keep your priorities straight. Don't badmouth others just to make yourself look good."}, "virgo": {"personal": "A sudden desire for independence from the confines of a job, stagnant home life, or relationship that isn't working could seem irresistible right now, virgo. You might have some outrageous ideas for changing jobs, moving, or finding a new partner. These ideas might be more workable than they seem, but this isn't the day to make decisions. Wait a few days and then consider your ideas again.", "amor": "You could be the center of attention today. This brings you and your partner ever more close together, as you genuinely have so much in common. To make the day complete, get out and meet up with friends who inspire laughter and a sense of humor. Just don't over-indulge and drink too much, or else you really will have everyone staring at you!", "trabajo": "Creative moneymaking opportunities are likely to come your way via the internet or some other computer-based network you are involved with. Embrace any opportunity that gives you the chance to use your artistic, teaching, and imaginative abilities."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You probably aren't going to feel like socializing even though friends want you to go out with them. Your patience could be worn a bit thin, capricorn, and you may get annoyed at incidents that normally wouldn't bother you. This isn't a good day for group activities or parties. It might be best to get a good workout and then rest. You will feel much better afterward.", "amor": "Today you may have to make some effort to patch up your relationship. You may not even remember what you and your loved one fell out about, but you need to start talking again. Even if it is hard to make the first move, it is well worth the effort to do so. You both have enough interest to want to be together again.", "trabajo": "Mundane, routine, boring things have no appeal to you whatsoever. Today is one of those days, however, where you must embrace these kinds of issues and deal with them. Get back to the basis. Find your grounding. Take care of the foundation."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Get off the couch and get into action. Come out of hiding and let others hear what you have to say. Let your emotions shine and don't be concerned about what others think. Dance like no one's watching. Passion will be the key to manifesting your dreams. This is a great day to act bravely toward those dreams.", "amor": "Although communication ought to be fairly straightforward with today's astral configuration, it may not be quite that simple. If you have just started out on a new relationship, then you may not be being quite honest with each other, for whatever reasons. You may both be in the situation where you feel you can reveal so much, but no more. Many things are hidden from view.", "trabajo": "Aggression with other people in the workplace may become destructive today if you aren't careful. Remember that you are working as a team. There is no need to compete with your teammates. The idea is to work together. Aim for cooperation."}, "aries": {"personal": "Get things started. You have many fantastic ideas. Really, the hardest thing for you now is to choose which one to pursue first. Activities that engage your creativity and sensitivity are most appealing now. Give some strength to your heart, which is normally seen as being tender and overly sensitive. Know that you're brave and go for the gold.", "amor": "With today's celestial energy, there is quite a big difference between love in the fast lane and love on the super highway. Right now there is a window of opportunity that may open just long enough to get a look at wonderful relationship, but will close just as fast if you don't seize the chance. You will have to be quick, otherwise you may miss it if you blink.", "trabajo": "You are ready to take the lead on a certain project at work, but unfortunately, it seems that one of your co-workers has the same idea. Sharing the leadership role is not going to be so easy, so don't bother trying. Find a different solution."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Key in to your sensual, beautiful nature, pisces. Take time each day to tend to your soul and make sure it gets the nourishment it needs to radiate into the world. Unexpected people are likely to appear out of nowhere, so don't be surprised when a former lover comes knocking on the door. Events from the past may travel to the present in order to teach you a valuable life lesson.", "amor": "You enjoy being the boss, so today you may have the good fortune of meeting someone who enjoys being bossed around. This could take place at work or at a special evening out, but the attraction between you will be unmistakable. Whilst others may not be able to understand the relationship, you will both understand how much you mean to each other.", "trabajo": "You are feeling super-charged in all ways. There is a greater force behind everything you do and everything you say. You can accomplish a great deal, so stay on track and go after the things that matter most. You are fully supported at this time."}}
