{"libra": {"personal": "This day will be agreeable, libra. There is a dynamic energy in the air that's fueling your fire. Have a good time regardless of what you do. An adventurous, high-spirited approach will get you where you need to go in every situation. You have the power to make important transformations that will help you in the future.", "amor": "If you feel a little grumpier than usual today, it is probably due to the atmosphere created by the planetary configuration. Of course nobody will really take you seriously, and your nearest and dearest will continue to tease you, but still, you may be in need of a little humorous resuscitation. Try to get out to see a comedy show, or stay in and watch a laugh-a-minute video."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "sagittarius, try not to be fooled by others. If you don't know a person well and you aren't sure about him or her, trust your instincts. You tend to care about others, so it can be easy for you to feel sorry for someone and bend over backward to help. Make sure that the person you help really deserves it and you know the whole story. This can save you problems down the road.", "amor": "The current aspect gives you all the confidence you need to express your feelings to someone whom you admire intensely. You may have wondered if it would be better to let them have the first word, but time is passing and you may be impatient to start the ball rolling. A conversation you have with them today could be very significant. You will feel jubilant!"}, "cancer": {"personal": "You might feel like your heart requires a bit more attention than usual, cancer. There could be a close loved one who is even needier than you. Either way, this situation is going to cause tension in an important relationship. If you're not currently involved with someone, this is probably for the better. Things aren't always as they seem.", "amor": "Today you have a chance to dispel an illusion that has been causing you some problems for a while now. A certain relationship may have been taking up more and more of your time, and paradoxically, the more you give, the more they have seemed to want. You realize you have been taken for a ride, and it is time to pull back and reestablish some healthy boundaries."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Even though you should watch your finances, you have a tendency to spend a lot of money, scorpio. Happily, you have the opportunity to make a lot of profit. Your investments are solid, and you will soon benefit from them. Don't spend your newfound wealth on frivolous things. You will fulfill your objectives if you're vigilant.", "amor": "It seems that there could some surprises in store for you today. Romantically, you may meet someone from the past at work, where you least expect it. This may be quite a shock, but if you can rally yourself, you may be in for yet another surprise, as you discover they are about to come back into your life in a big way."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You might host a social event in your home tonight, aquarius. You may be nervous at first, wondering if all will go well. Your efforts should produce the results you want. You might be introduced to new contacts, which could lead to increased professional opportunities. Take a walk after everyone has gone. Your mind will be going a thousand miles an hour and you will want to clear your head.", "amor": "You do need to come out of your shell today and try and do something constructive about your situation. Hiding away won't make anything better. The current celestial configuration brings a golden opportunity to speak your mind, if you can bear to be open and honest. Don't try and coerce your partner with feelings of guilt, or overpower them, as you both need to be able to speak from the heart."}, "taurus": {"personal": "This isn't a good day to get together with your romantic partner, taurus, or even talk on the phone at length. Keep your conversations brief and make arrangements to meet in a few days. Your friend could be in a very agitated state of mind and might take offense at an innocent remark from you. This could cause an unpleasant quarrel. Be patient!", "amor": "It is never too late to say yes, or no, for that matter. Today you will come to a crossroads, where you may dally at your leisure, yet not for too long. Yes - it's decision time! But before you make any pledges, just consider where you will both be in a year's time. If it still looks very passionate, then go for it."}, "leo": {"personal": "You may be tormented by an important decision today, leo. The good news is that once you make up your mind, you will feel much better about yourself. Until then, however, you may vacillate from one side to the other. Asking others for advice may put you in even more of a quandary. The only one who can decide your path is you.", "amor": "This is a warm and comforting day, when being close to your lover brings you a deep feeling of security. The current celestial aspect gives you a chance to relax. As there is very little conflict between you, you are both happy to listen to what the other has to say about the relationship, about life, about everything. Just enjoy that tender feeling of togetherness."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Have you been putting off some work? It may be weighing on your mind. You could work extra hard today to get it out of the way. Afterward you'll feel relieved, but don't push yourself too hard or you won't have any energy left for tomorrow. If some of the tasks don't get done, that's OK. They've waited this long, so another day won't hurt.", "amor": "The current astral configuration gives you a chance to choose the wiser course of action concerning an intimate relationship. It may be a good idea to take some time out to quietly reflect on all the options open to you. But of all the possibilities, the idea of some kind of revenge is best ignored. In fact, humor and laughter are the best ways of dealing with this."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "It's time to get down to work, capricorn. At the moment, you can't depend solely on your natural creativity, spontaneity, imagination, and originality to get by. You need to demonstrate a certain amount of pragmatism and self-discipline to reach your goals. This will certainly seem more difficult than it really is. It's time to have faith in attributes other than your intuition.", "amor": "Today's aslignment of the planets could mean that you have a chance to get out and do some things on your own - providing a much needed break from your current relationship, which may have been proving rather difficult over recent times. This chance for space may well bring about a revolution in your understanding of the whole situation. You won't want to repeat the same mistakes."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Listen to the birds today, gemini. They have a song for you, telling you to be happy. Take time to do things that make you feel good. Connect with creative people and projects that get your artistic juices flowing. Keep things light and uplifting. It may be hard to make a decision about anything right now, but don't let that keep you from being productive.", "amor": "The energy of the day brings some of your brightest and most impertinent fantasies to the forefront, although you often find it difficult to make a decision as to which you should try first. As most people find you to be often very compliant, perhaps it would also be good therapy to try out the fantasy where for once you are completely, totally, and utterly in charge."}, "aries": {"personal": "Do you need a change of pace, aries? If things are beginning to feel boring and you're apathetic, chances are that you do. All you have to do is figure out what to shift. If you're home most of the time, change the furniture around. It can make the house seem new. Consider putting up new pictures or bringing in fresh flowers. Switch your schedule around. This will energize you.", "amor": "This day brings with it a feeling of excitement. You and your partner may both benefit by taking a break from your daily routine and getting out to do something really different. Try anything with that added element of danger, such as white water canoeing, parachuting, or motor racing. You will probably appreciate each other a whole lot more after going through this unique experience together."}, "pisces": {"personal": "An unexpected and perhaps unwelcome call or email from a co-worker might mean you have to work some extra hours, pisces. This could be frustrating. You may feel that someone is taking unfair advantage of you. If you aren't up to doing it, say no. This won't affect your long-term standing with this person. Otherwise, grit your teeth, dig in, and think of it as a favor.", "amor": "The current planetary alignment does not really create the perfect energy for a first date. There are strong possibilities that in some way or another you will manage to rub each other the wrong way. This doesn't have to be so if you can manage not to rock the boat, yet even you like to ruffle feathers if you are feeling especially wicked. Don't overdo it!"}}
