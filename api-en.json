{"libra": {"personal": "Be a little selfish, libra. Be honest and straightforward with what you want. There's no need to beat around the bush simply because you want to spare someone's feelings. You will do everyone a favor by laying it out clearly. Refrain from playing mind games just to see how much you can twist people into knots. Such actions will later come back to haunt you.", "amor": "The current celestial energy may arouse your suspicions, and yet you may not be able to point your finger at any particular incident to support your growing concerns. In this instance you really need to have that conversation, because if you continue to say nothing while silently accusing them of everything - nothing will be resolved. At least when you have the facts you can make an informed decision."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "You may fall into a bottomless pit today, Aries. Be careful about offering so much of yourself that you drain your internal resources. You might think other people will be equally generous about offering themselves to you. Don't assume this. You're better off assuming that you will get nothing in return. Play your cards from this standpoint and you may be a bit more conservative.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "You are always ready to help out those who are less fortunate than yourself. Today, while attending some kind of voluntary program or helping those in need, you may meet the person of your dreams. The cosmos suggests that this may not be the hottest person at the disco, but they will surely have the biggest heart in town. You will be impressed by their genuine kindness."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You're a real charmer. None of your friends can resist you, cancer. Today you should try to put the finishing touches to your personality. Indeed, you will be able to benefit from the planetary alignment as you interact with others. You will look for a little more authenticity in your personal and professional relations.", "amor": "A sudden event can prove to be a very positive way of moving you in just the right direction. You may have been merrily proceeding along a certain route, when suddenly something spins you round and round, and you are off on a new tangent. Whatever transpires today between you and your partner, be sure that the change will do both your hearts good, and bring you closer together."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Your general mood is at a peak today, although this mood is slightly off due to indecision on your part, scorpio. Don't let this get you down. If you find it hard to make a choice about something, the solution is simple. Put off making the choice until you feel more comfortable about it. If you must make a decision today, go with your instincts.", "amor": "The energy of the day may make you extremely aware of how fortunate you are. You have a wonderful, caring, nurturing partner who only wants the best for you. And perhaps that's just the problem. You can have too much of a good thing. So, out of the blue comes someone else, who only wants to very wicked and naughty. The choice is yours - and yes you are definitely lucky!"}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Jump back on stage and say what you have to say, aquarius. Your participation in the conversation is critical to maintaining a healthy energy flow. The things you say will have a profound effect on others, so chose your words carefully. Enjoy a physical activity that involves a group. Make it a social event. Be an active participant in all situations today.", "amor": "It is when speaking about certain values or principles, or talking about certain things that you believe in that you may find yourself drawn to a certain person who seems to share the same ideas and ideals that you do. The astral climate means that conversation becomes the key to a whole lot more than you could have imagined. You certainly will discover the power of words."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Someone you're very fond of could be in a difficult mood today. Don't let your sensitivity get the better of you, taurus. Don't take offense at what this person may say in frustration. Intuit what they're feeling and be your usual compassionate self. This could strengthen your relationship and make you feel good, too.", "amor": "If your loved one seems to be acting a little strangely, don't take it to heart. Today your sweetie may just need space to putter around with their weird hobbies, and will be back later, after they have satisfied their more peculiar tastes. You, too, may have some unique talents, so why not give them a whirl while you have the chance?"}, "leo": {"personal": "Be gentle and reserved in your approach, leo. There's a great deal of tenderness in the air that you should tune into and enjoy. Do things to improve your home. Make amends with the people you live with and clear the air so that relations will be calm in the future. You have a great deal of yourself invested in making your home a sanctuary, so respect and nourish it.", "amor": "Partners are great fun to be with today, especially if you have been experiencing some particularly difficult highs and lows in other areas of your life. The planetary energy means that there is a very attentive and supportive influence between you. It brings you closer together, especially in a deeper caring and sharing way. This will have a powerful healing effect on both of you."}, "virgo": {"personal": "You may find yourself bursting into tears for no apparent reason today, virgo. Seek comfort in sitting by a body of water where you can let your emotions flow. Tension builds as the storm draws near. Once it has passed, however, there is calm as the sunshine pierces the clouds. This time of peace and serenity may seem far off, but it's closer than you think.", "amor": "You perhaps need to see how not being able to accept others as they are is bringing your current relationship into some difficult waters. The planetary alignment is bringing to your attention a pattern of behavior that is making it difficult for others to get really close to you. If you can stop yourself before you are about to repeat this behavior, you will be able to gradually change it."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Trying to get too much work done in the course of the day could prove self-defeating, capricorn. Your energy isn't what it usually is, and you're probably operating on adrenaline. Consider the situation carefully and list your tasks in order of urgency. The world won't come to an end if you don't get them all done by the end of the day. In the evening, watch a movie and order a pizza.", "amor": "The current aspect gives you and your partner (current or prospective) a chance to lighten up after going through what can only be described as a particularly heavy time. You need this break to see that the recent events have not done any real damage to your relationship as a couple, but have merely put you through your paces. Use this opportunity to go out somewhere special and have fun.\n \n \n \n "}, "gemini": {"personal": "You may have to bring yourself down to ground level in a rather sobering fashion, gemini. Maybe you're forgetting an important piece of a goal that you've been shooting for. This is a good day to review your progress and deal with any details that require attention. Keep your adventurous spirit alive, but have at least one foot on solid ground.", "amor": "If you are thinking of writing a love note to your dearest heart, then it would be better to try and make it as simple and straight to the point as possible. The aspect at play may indicate that anything too fancy or any attempt at being amusing may be taken the wrong way, and this could create a false barrier between you. Be as unambiguous and open as possible."}, "aries": {"personal": "Concerns about your home or mother may mean you have to deal with some rather unpleasant or untrustworthy people. Lack of knowledge could have you in a quandary about how to address the situation. It would be a good idea to prepare by gathering all the facts you might need. Stay centered and focused, aries, and use your inner strength to hold out for the best for all concerned.", "amor": "There is the possibility of a lot of warmth and good feeling around today. You could experience joy and exuberance in your close relationships. It is also a great time for parties and any kind of travel. Don't try to use all your energy at once, and get exhausted. It would benefit both of you to try and pace the day; otherwise, you'll be tired before it has begun."}, "pisces": {"personal": "This is your day to shine, so turn it up a notch, pisces. Brush your hair before you go out, and make sure you're wearing flattering attire. You have the chance to propel your emotions into an upward spiral. If there's a part of your life that feels stagnant, give it a jolt of creative energy or simply remove it from your life.", "amor": "A sunny atmosphere will pervade the air today, especially given the current planetary configuration. There is a feeling of optimism all around. You and your loved one could take advantage of this to just enjoy being together, and also to enjoy the presence of treasured friends. It's a great time to hold a party to celebrate the good things in life and the wonderful company around you."}}
