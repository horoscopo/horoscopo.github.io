{"libra": {"personal": "Everybody knows that you're very strong willed. You've always had a very active disposition. You have the ability to surmount all obstacles and soak up all the energy that comes to your aid. It seems that today your strength could be reinforced by some people you meet or by your group of friends, libra.", "amor": "Today brings with it a feeling of attraction for someone you know who is in a position of authority. Whether it is possible for you to get together may or may not be the case, but for the moment you will be enthralled to discover that you have certain strong interests in common. What you do next is entirely up to your conscience.", "trabajo": "Good luck will come from unexpected people and places. Ironically, the less organized you are, the more apt you will be to stumble across the perfect opportunity that you have been waiting for. Adopt a carefree attitude and you will succeed."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Today's energy has you rethinking all areas of your life, sagittarius. If you aren't as challenged by your job as you think you should be, perhaps it's time for a change. The trick for you will be figuring out what it is that you want to do. You have a tremendous amount of creative ability. If you aren't using these talents, why not explore a career that would let you develop them further?", "amor": "Today you may find it rather difficult to broach a certain subject with someone very close to you. The celestial energy indicates that there seems to be a barrier there on both sides that does not make this easy. However much effort you have to expend, it will be worth it. It is always worth trying to reach out and make amends. Don't leave it too long.", "trabajo": "Use your head today. The tendency will be for you to get extremely emotional over the work you are doing. Don't let your feelings overwhelm you or take over completely. Turn to rational thinking and sound logical ideas for your answers."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Your four walls could seem to be closing in on you today, Sagittarius. You might feel that you'll go crazy if you don't get out for a while. But responsibilities may keep you indoors anyway. It's important to get out. Take a brisk walk around the neighborhood, run a quick errand, return a book to the library. This should bring some relief, at least for now.", "amor": "An unexpected development in your local area, or even a meeting with a friend, may spark off a whirlwind romance that defies all your attempts at sensible explanation. With the astral energy at play, you have many chances today to enter a world of dramatic new proportions. It is the world of another who thinks in ways very different from your own, yet who seems to understand you completely.", "trabajo": "Making decisions will be difficult for you. Your first reaction will be to get extremely frustrated at yourself. Don't beat yourself up just because you can't decide. It is perfectly fine to weigh all of your options at this time. Indecision is okay."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "You're apt to feel emotionally brave today, Capricorn, so take advantage of this feeling by extending it to the people around you. Try not to get anxious or jump ahead of yourself. Enjoy where you are at this very moment. Don't get stressed about things you feel you need to do. Be happy with yourself regardless of what you end up accomplishing.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "If you want to make an impact on your partner (current or prospective) and loved one today, then don't pursue the same line of argument that you have done for the past number of weeks. The current celestial energy urges you to find a different way of approaching the whole subject in order to have any real effect. But don't worry; the answer WILL arrive out of the blue - thankfully.", "trabajo": "Your mood is upbeat for most of the day, making it easier for you to accomplish your work with a smile. The only potential pitfall in today's work has to do with your mental preoccupation. You can't seem to get your mind off of a certain loved one."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You're very tolerant toward a particular person in your entourage, which is probably due to your generous nature, aquarius. You think everyone should have his or her own experiences and setbacks. After all, we learn from our mistakes. Sometimes you aren't very humble, but your friends are lucky to have someone they can count on.", "amor": "There may be some highly charged emotions about today, which could threaten to disrupt the status quo. You may no idea of what could come your way. This may be a much-needed chance to make some space away from each other and find time to be alone. The emotions experienced now are a sign that perhaps a cooling off period is needed.", "trabajo": "Expensive gadgets will not necessarily make your job easier. Don't buy into a gimmick just because everyone else is. You may waste more time trying to figure out how to run this new apparatus than if you were to just do things the old fashioned way."}, "taurus": {"personal": "This will be an interesting day provided you keep your eyes and ears open to the opportunities that arise. Don't be afraid to take on new challenges. Even if you feel unsure about your abilities, embrace the chance to test them. If others think you're up to the challenge, you should give yourself the same benefit of the doubt! New friends are indicated - make a point to smile.", "amor": "There seems to be a lot of pushing and shoving around today, not only in your general environment, but also in your love life. Neither of you is in the mood to give an inch, even you, the master of compromise. However, the day's planetary energy does indicate that you can both have the opportunity to do something pleasant together. Plan a common goal rather than fighting.", "trabajo": "The general pace slows down a bit today and you will find that this is the trend for the next three weeks. During this time, you should concentrate on gathering facts and planning. There is no rush. Take your time and be patient."}, "leo": {"personal": "There are important lessons to learn today, so listen closely. You may have been thinking other people should grow up. Even if you haven't spoken those words to them directly, you've thought them to yourself. Understand now that perhaps you're the one who needs to do a little growing. Don't write people off so quickly. There's something important to learn from everyone.", "amor": "You won't be able to hide your delight, especially with today's astral energy on your side. Perhaps you didn't want to look too pleased with your new love interest, just in case they stopped trying so hard to do all the right things. But they have such a warm and sunny personality that this has the effect of melting the rather cool image that you continuously try to maintain.", "trabajo": "Today marks the start of a four-week cycle in which you will be either reaping the rewards or realizing your failures. This is a very climactic period for you, so get ready for major evaluation and change."}, "virgo": {"personal": "The Universe is inviting you magnify your vision, Pisces. It's time to see the bigger, better, more advanced side of things. Remember that life is a mirror. You're highly unlikely to receive more than you hope for. So dream big, hope big, and imagine yourself in the stars. Don't sell yourself short. It's a misuse of humility and modesty.", "amor": "Although you generally understand that all life is one, you may feel that the planetary energy is somehow encouraging you to take this much further. While your latest sweetheart may wish for nothing more than to take a walk with you somewhere peaceful and tranquil, you prefer today to sit in on the latest metaphysical discussion about soul mates and the mystical aspects of true love.", "trabajo": "Unexpected information will come from a co-worker today. Pay attention to this little tidbit of knowledge. The tips you learn on the job right now will help you tremendously when you decide to move on to something new or spread your own wings."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You'll be at an advantage if you can learn to distance yourself from the emotional crux of the matter. Maintain a neutral viewpoint. It will be important in order for you to conduct yourself in the way you need to in order to be successful. Great flashes of inspiration result as long as you can keep your mental processes running smoothly.", "amor": "The current aspect at play is wonderful for dissolving knots, tensions, and barriers within a current relationship. If you have both been going through a difficult time recently, then use this great opportunity to do something special together and recreate that warm and loving feeling between you. Try a romantic meal for two, or a night out at a show. Do anything that will help you to relax.", "trabajo": "Your well-laid plan is likely to get shaken up today by someone who has a great deal of influence on you. Don't be afraid to integrate a new idea or concept into a traditional way of doing something. Doing so will create the winning combination."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Watch your back today, Taurus. There's a distinct presence nearby that requires your attention. Luckily, your emotions are a lot more stable than usual, and you're more strongly connected with your feelings. In fact, you may be in the clouds. You shouldn't have any problem navigating through this part of the atmosphere. Others may look to you for advice.", "amor": "If you don't make something quite plain, the elements of your love life could become very confused. The energy of today's astral configuration has the same effect as a very misty day, and words or certain statements made by you or your beloved could be taken in several different ways. So it is wise to keep your wits about you if trying to get an important point across.", "trabajo": "Other people will be critical of your work today so you should be too. Make sure you check things two or three times before you submit them for review or before you move on to the next project. Take your time and do the job well instead of rushing."}, "aries": {"personal": "This isn't a good day to get together with your romantic partner, aries, or even talk on the phone at length. Keep your conversations brief and make arrangements to meet in a few days. Your friend could be in a very agitated state of mind and might take offense at an innocent remark from you. This could cause an unpleasant quarrel. Be patient!", "amor": "A great day is ahead because you have much to offer others. You love to reach out and help, especially when you see that people are going through a difficult time. By sympathizing with another, you may meet someone who becomes very special to you. In reaching out to you for understanding, they also reveal a tenderness that you had forgotten existed.", "trabajo": "A burst of positive energy is available to you and has a positive influence on your work. You feel stronger and more powerful than ever. If there is a deal you need to make or someone you need to persuade, this is most certainly the day to do it. You will succeed."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Today it may seem like home and family responsibilities are interfering with your social life, pisces, including a get-together you really want to attend. Don't worry. All signs are that something unexpected will occur at the last minute that makes it possible for you to proceed with your plans. Try to take care of your duties as efficiently as you can so you can enjoy the evening.", "amor": "It is your great sense of humor that comes to the rescue in terms of one significant relationship. Today's aspect gives you just the edge you need in the communications department to help you to get around a certain argument that a loved one may put forward. You won't win by trying to force the issue, or by burying your head in the sand, but by making them laugh.", "trabajo": "Creative self-expression will play a big part in your work today. Get inspired by children. Their high-energy, fearlessness and pure spunk will inspire you to dredge out these qualities in yourself and put them to good use. You have much to offer."}}
