While you may want to sink into tender feelings and sensitivity, others may want to float on the surface and dabble in fantasy worlds. Feel free to escape in your own world for a while, but don't be surprised if others don't follow.", "amor": "You tend to be full of promises, because promises are the potential new gateway through which tomorrow dawns bright and fair. Funny though, how people like promises to be kept, especially if they are extravagant to start off with. A certain romantic promise you make today needs to be spoken in terms you can keep and another can accept. Otherwise you may have a problem on your hands.", "trabajo": "Break things down with co-workers who can help you see the flaws in your plan.

You will be done with your tasks when they're just getting started on theirs!", "amor": "You need water in order to germinate and grow seeds, and you also need love in order for relationships to blossom and develop. The current celestial energy encourages you to share your deeper feelings with someone special, so that the bond you have nurtured will turn into something truly wonderful. It is so easy to forget to do this, but so necessary.", "trabajo": "You have a good perspective from where you are sitting at the current time.

You may want to move these people out of your life."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Slow down the pace today, Pisces. This is a day to sit back and observe and contemplate. Your mind may go in a hundred different directions, and you may be unsure which route to take. Try to quiet the buzzing chatter within. Be receptive to the loving, sensitive forces around you. Try not to disturb the flow by bringing up unrelated issues and hurtful gossip.", "amor": "The energy of the day may finally help you to realize that you have another option in the ongoing saga of your current relationship. First though, you need to engage in some serious discussion about the kind of future you envision together, and whether you are both expecting the same thing. If not, then this is what you need to attend to before it is too late.", "trabajo": "You are wishing and waiting for someone to contact you. You wait desperately by the phone or the computer waiting for the news you want to hear. Don't waste your day in this manner. Either contact this person yourself or let it go."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Some strange communications could come your way today, Virgo. Hang-ups or blank emails could have you wondering who the person is and what they want from you. This is probably due more to problems with phone lines or Internet connections than to anything else, so don't waste time worrying. If you think you know who's trying to reach you, wait until tomorrow and contact him or her.", "amor": "Is your sugar bunches coming across as the authoritarian again? The energy of the day may induce them to pretend to control the household. Meanwhile, you feel like one of those puppets dancing to whatever tune they happen to prefer.

You should enjoy a good mood and social times with others. Don't do anything that requires discipline or realistic thinking. This is a better day to simply have fun and relax. If you must work, do your best to keep your mood up. You can have fun even if you're being productive with menial tasks and duties.", "amor": "You may feel that the attitude of someone important to you seems very superficial, and does not really address the heart of the problem. The movement of the heavenly bodies is actually encouraging you both to stand back and see the difficulty between you from a more detached perspective. It is also urging you both to think of your relationship as an adventure, rather than something that has become a chore.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "It is not too late to capitalize on a fantastic opportunity of yesterday.
