{"libra": {"personal": "Engage in lively activities with friends who keep you abreast of the latest in culture, Scorpio. See a movie, go to a bookstore, or visit a museum. This should be a fun time in which you can bounce ideas around and explore your thoughts and feelings. Be careful that your conversation doesn't lapse into gossip. Don't let everyone else's affairs suddenly become more important than yours.", "amor": "Today you will feel the need for freedom. You have many ideas and projects that you would very much like to try out alone, and you really could do with some space. There is no need to create bad feelings between you and your loved one. Just explain that time spent alone now will mean that you enjoy each other's company a lot more later.", "trabajo": "Your thinking is right on target, but your concentration leaves quite a bit to be desired. Your ideas are good, but your application of them is not so good. Do your best to focus and implement your good ideas and you will be tremendously successful."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "A rush of communication heightens love and romance today. Feelings and memories are willingly shared. Either you or your partner could reveal something that the other didn't know, which could strengthen the bond between you. Some of what's exchanged might be a little surprising, but your relationship should be much better for all the open, honest, and loving communication.", "amor": "If your loved one does not seem very forthcoming today, don't despair. The mood will not last. They need to mull a few things over before they can explain to you what exactly is going on in their head. Just because you usually blurt out everything that springs to mind without thinking doesn't mean that others necessarily follow the same pattern.", "trabajo": "Missed appointments and missed phone calls have been commonplace during the past few weeks. Today, things ease up and messes become organized again, suggesting that these types of work-related incidents will be running smoothly again."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Today you may feel like you're brimming over with physical energy. You have a lot of energy, but it isn't a good idea to go climbing mountains, running marathons, or swimming long distances right now. If you don't pace yourself, you could be exhausted by midafternoon. You may be temporarily operating on nervous energy and limited stamina.", "amor": "Today you have a chance to dispel an illusion that has been causing you some problems for a while now. A certain relationship may have been taking up more and more of your time, and paradoxically, the more you give, the more they have seemed to want. You realize you have been taken for a ride, and it is time to pull back and reestablish some healthy boundaries.", "trabajo": "Any indecision that you have felt in the past couple of days is completely gone, and you are ready to move forward. This is the day to get a head start on new projects. Move forward. Take the first steps necessary. You are at a new starting point."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "If you've wanted to take a class in astrology, science, or computers, it's time to sign up. If you're already taking such a class, expect a fascinating, stimulating discussion in connection with it. Make sure you take notes, as you won't want to forget this information as soon as you hear it.", "amor": "You're going to love the way your sugar honey talks to you today. Their words have soft, sexy, and very sultry overtones. You may find yourself the object of intensely passionate desire, and the turning point in the whole seductive process is a particular conversation that enables you to realize that there is far more depth and real understanding between you than you ever realized.", "trabajo": "Your energy will come in short, powerful bursts. The highs will be high, but the lows will be low. Take advantage of the highs, but don't dwell on the lows. Other people may give you the nickname, \"yo-yo\". You will certainly earn it today."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Be bold and aggressive today, aquarius. Even if this isn't in your nature, dynamic action can be rewarding on a day like this. People will be delighted to hear from you. Your opinion is precious. You have many insights to offer the group. Your adaptable nature will be tested. You may need to make adjustments in order to match other people's way of thinking.", "amor": "This day brings with it a wonderful surprise. You may not be ready for the unique experience that is due to come your way, simply because you would never have imagined it possible. However, it seems that destiny is about to announce a fork in the road, opening up a whole new path. And you won't be passing this way alone, but with someone very special by your side.", "trabajo": "Your mood isn't especially strong today, so it is just as well that you are not at work, or else your overall mood would be much worse. If you do have to put in time at work, do your best to make peace instead of war with those around you."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Some intense dreams about someone you haven't seen for a long time could have you wondering what this person is doing now, taurus. It might also awaken the desire to be in contact again. Call if you can. You might be pleasantly surprised. An increased psychic sensitivity could cause you to better understand the thoughts and feelings of family members. Communication of all kinds should go well today.", "amor": "Easy come, easy go is often your motto concerning life, love, and relationships. Today you don't seem bothered whether your sweet love stays with you or not. You feel so strangely indifferent to their desperate pleas that you are ready to tell them you just don't care, after all. But don't dismiss them altogether, as they truly care about you! And anyway, tomorrow is another day!", "trabajo": "You are frustrated by the doors closing in your face, but don't be. These are messages from the universe steering you in the right direction. Some things are not meant to be - accept this and move on. The right door will open at the right time."}, "leo": {"personal": "The day ahead will be trying for you, Taurus. You will have a fire raging inside. You may have a speech to deliver or a private performance to put on for your loved ones. In any case, you will have to prove yourself, and you will spare no energy in the attempt. You will be completely drained by the end of the day. Plan to rest.", "amor": "Today's aspect could mean that as one plan appears to be going down the drain, another plan that you had thought untenable now seems the best solution. Although you may have experienced difficulties in a close current relationship, there is real hope for healing, as long as you can both discuss your feelings, and be realistic rather than idealistic about your life together.", "trabajo": "Let the day take you where it wants to instead of feeling that you need to control every single move you make. You will go down the right path if you let go and roll with the punches. It may feel foreign at first, but try to stay open-minded."}, "virgo": {"personal": "This could shape up to be a busy day, Aquarius. You're concentrating on two things. The first is working with computers and other technology, possibly in a creative capacity. The second is interacting with a lot of new people. Your contact with these people could be very pleasant and quite stimulating, so make the most of the opportunities.", "amor": "This is a day when you could realize just what you have been missing in a certain relationship. You notice that, while on the surface it all seems fine, there is a distinct lack of real passion. That spark that makes you pine for each other when out of each other's sight is no longer there. Now you have to decide what to do about it.", "trabajo": "Calm down and think clearly. Lately you may have become reckless with your actions. This is the time to stop and sort out your wild ideas. Slow down. With a clear head, weed out the bad ideas from the good. Don't try to pursue all of them at once."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Your mind might be on power struggles that have caused quarrels among your friends, placing you in an uncomfortable position. Conflicting loyalties might come up when others draw you into the fray, capricorn. Stay out of it! You could get angry, and this wouldn't do you any good. Think of something else until you calm down and regain your perspective.", "amor": "Today may find you attracted to the presence of an authority figure, either at work, or in some other area of your life. Although there may be some kind of conflict involved in actually getting together, it is this that makes the whole idea so exciting. It may be worth a shot, and will be all the more rewarding when you do eventually meet.", "trabajo": "You are in a good position to capitalize on the feisty energy of the day. Others are bringing key issues to the table and you are perfectly poised to offer resolution to conflicting perspectives. Be assertive, while taking all viewpoints into account."}, "gemini": {"personal": "A number of interesting visitors could come to your home today. At least one could be from a foreign country, and some could be in the educational field. You can expect some interesting conversations, and you might learn some fascinating facts on a subject that's new to you. You could enjoy learning this so much that you look for books on the subject tomorrow.", "amor": "There is an extra special feeling around today which is emphasized by the celestial alignment. This reveals that friendships, and also those relationships that haven't quite reached the partnership stage, but may be slowly edging in this direction, are treading a fine and quite delicious line. How far you step over this is entirely up to you. At least you will have the chance to deepen significant connections.", "trabajo": "You are likely to get bogged down in an emotional drama at your work today that you simply have nothing to do with. Do your best to stay above this conflict by keeping your focus on your own work and your own needs. Rely on only yourself."}, "aries": {"personal": "Remind yourself of all the positive things you have going on in your life now, aries. It's possible that you'll be met with tension and challenges today that are threatening your sense of self. Arguments may break out around you, and you may have questions regarding what it is you stand for. Don't lose touch with your nurturing qualities and sixth sense.", "amor": "If you are single and looking for love, you can expect it to come in a mysterious way today. You may find yourself very much drawn to someone whilst at a religious gathering, or while visiting a friend in hospital. This will be the beginning of a unique stage in your life. It may take a while to get going, but will develop steadily in the right direction.", "trabajo": "You are feeling confident and strong in the workplace, so why isn't everyone listening to you? Instead, they are working counter to your aims, making it difficult for you to do your job. Stick to what you know instead of worrying about everyone else."}, "pisces": {"personal": "You're thinking about friends and family members who live far away and wondering what they're doing. You could feel a little nostalgic, longing for times long past. Don't dwell on it. Call your friends. They'll be glad to hear from you and you'll feel more positive about the day. In the evening, give some attention to those you love who live nearby.", "amor": "Perhaps romantic is not the right word for the events that may ensue today. One minute you may be all over your loved one, and the next out somewhere by yourself. Your emotions may be a little erratic. There may not be a lot you can do, except explain how you feel and ask your partner to give you some space.", "trabajo": "The atmosphere around the workplace has a very different quality today than it did yesterday. People are more serious and emotional. Take this into account as you interact with others. Tread lightly or you may hurt someone's sensitive feelings."}}
