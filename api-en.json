{"libra": {"personal": "Some hidden problems in your house could suddenly appear, libra. This could involve plumbing, electricity, or the walls. Repairs are definitely indicated. It's best if you see to them right away rather than wait. The problem will only escalate if neglected. It's probably better to call in professionals than to try to do it yourself. Things like this are a drag, but they happen.", "amor": "This may seem like a day when things seem slow but also sweet. There may be a lot of talking about things that don't seem to have any relevance as far as you are concerned. But it does give the opportunity for you to actually digest a meal if you are taking your loved one out - which may be a good idea. Harmony reigns and even your stomach stays calm.", "trabajo": "You are on the brink of something big, but yet you are still one step away. The good news is that this one step is just a small one. You are actually much closer than you think. Hang in there. A breakthrough will come as early as tonight."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Something might be shaking the very ground you stand on, sagittarius. Just when you thought everything was calm and stable, suddenly the ground begins to rumble. Secure your footing, hold on, and stay flexible. A few steps in a different direction may position you in a safe area where you can ride out the storm with no problem. Becoming too fixed and rigid would be a bad idea.", "amor": "Today you have a chance to see a problem from a unique perspective. The angle from which you perceive it makes a whole big difference between giving up on someone, and allowing them back into your life. It is as though a light goes on in your head. You understand something about them that you just couldn't see before. Instead of blaming them, you forgive yourself.", "trabajo": "Your emotions will play a big role in your decision-making abilities. This will either help you or not, depending on how well you are able to manage your feelings. Use your passion by channeling it into your work instead of letting it turn into anger."}, "cancer": {"personal": "Today will destabilize you, cancer. You're trying to rebuild your life on new foundations. Perhaps should you try to change your point of view. Also, you need to preserve your perception, because it will allow you to adapt to all situations. You need to be fully alert and prepared at all times. Try not to become discouraged.", "amor": "Love and romance could become very intense, with today's celestial energy. If you have been hovering between two relationships, perhaps not having fully let go of one, and neither having totally embraced the other, then you could feel the need to get this sorted out. It is really a question of letting go of the old completely, so that the new can enter your life.", "trabajo": "A tremendous planetary shift takes place today - setting the stage for the next four weeks. For you, this shift will bring terrific opportunities in the world of jobs and career. Your practical, grounded nature will be recognized and appreciated."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Today family members might be less than honest with you, scorpio, particularly regarding working around the house. Don't be surprised if you hear excuses! This could be irritating, but don't let it get to you. Let the chores go. Do something you enjoy. It's more fun than taking out the trash.", "amor": "If you have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting for that special person to come along and fill your life with love, then take advantage of today's energy. This promises a heady passion not usually available to all and sundry. So go for the kill. Make your move on someone you find particularly attractive, and you could be deeply involved by the end of the evening.", "trabajo": "Bringing people together is one of your strong points. Exploit this ability. Teamwork is an important theme of the day, so as long as you can resonate with this goal, you will earn favor with everyone around you. Success is yours for the taking."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Think about old times and people with whom you've had strong connections, Leo. Remember the good times you shared with people of common interests and similar hobbies. Be sentimental and mushy. Mend bridges and bring resolution to sticky issues. Be harmonious with the people and situations around you. World peace begins with you. Incorporate more of this ideal into your life.", "amor": "The current aspect makes this a great time to pick out some fascinating and contentious topics of conversation, and go on your date armed with these plus a few juicy pieces of gossip. You may also need some New Age jokes for good measure. But seriously, you will certainly have a laugh, and your ability to find the same things funny will make the evening all that more enjoyable. What are the odds on seeing each other again?\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "Consider expansion on all fronts. Whatever you are working on, whatever your investment is, whatever your current job is, expand it. Embrace more, invest more, and work more. Dream even bigger than you usually do. Success is coming your way very soon."}, "taurus": {"personal": "You may be working on a large project that draws on your creative energy, Cancer. In terms of long-term goals and dreams, this sort of project is right up your alley. Today you might hit a snag or some sort of emotional block that could make it hard for you to continue. Slow down and take a break. Don't get discouraged.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "You take things philosophically, especially when they are not going according to plan. But today even your most metaphysical thoughts don't seem to bring the comfort you need. The planets reveal a flaw in your current relationship. This may only be temporary, so don't panic. But if you can work through it now, you may be able to prevent it from becoming serious.", "trabajo": "Your dreamy and original way of dealing with things is conflicting sharply with someone who has a very mental approach. Your two viewpoints clash drastically. You don't need to find compromise at this time. Simply understand the opposing argument."}, "leo": {"personal": "You may have been saving up for something you really wanted, leo, when an unexpected expense compels you to spend some of your savings. This could cause some gloom. Make sure you've exhausted all of your other options before digging into your nest egg. Appearances could be deceiving. There could be other resources at your disposal that you didn't immediately think of.", "amor": "The planets are aligning to encourage you to lighten up and get out for some fun, after a time of much hard work. If you are in a permanent partnership, then this will help you both relax and enable you to spend some time together. If you are hoping to meet someone who is upwardly mobile, then this could be just the opportunity you have been waiting for.", "trabajo": "Money matters will be a big focus of your day. There is a tendency for your entire mood to be dependent on how well you are doing financially. Try not to fall into this trap. If you do, you may end up getting angry with someone else unnecessarily."}, "virgo": {"personal": "Today a bubble of confusion clouds your reality, making it difficult to decide what to do next, Sagittarius. Be careful that you don't tie your stomach in knots from the tension created by your mental confusion. Problems with indigestion are likely now because of your worries over what your next step should be. Relax and go with the flow. Things will work out fine.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "There is an extremely powerful force in the air, which means you could use this energy to transform a certain situation for the better. With this you feel encouraged to summon your resources and break through a barrier that has been causing you a lot of consternation recently. You have enough determination, so go ahead, knowing that it can ultimately only improve matters between you and your love interest.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "You are feeling extremely confident and strong today, yet someone still thinks he or she knows better than you - and this person is going to challenge you on it. Be prepared for a showdown. Whatever you do, don't back down. Both of you can benefit."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You may feel neglected and unloved today, capricorn. If you're single, you may feel worse. Cheer up. If you're running around with such a depressed and dramatic expression on your face, nobody will feel like asking you out. Try to make yourself happy by doing things you like to do. If you smile, you'll be a magnet for someone who has love to give.", "amor": "With today's astral energy at play, you find that you have a rare meeting with someone who brings much more than a smile to your face; they also bring hope to your heart. You may have seen this person around for a while, but a certain incident will seem to connect you in a particularly powerful way. You won't forget this in a hurry!", "trabajo": "Your concern for others is quite noble, but make sure it doesn't snowball out of control. Your tendency is for you to get so caught up in other people's dramas that you lose sight of your own issues that need to be dealt with at this time."}, "gemini": {"personal": "You may need to use charm and wit to ease a tense situation, gemini. Gridlock could be making you feel uncomfortable. Your solution to the problem is to put on a happy face and divert attention from the difficulty by telling some jokes. Realize that this technique will delay having to face a particular situation for a while, but it certainly won't keep you from ever having to deal with it.", "amor": "You will find that your usual attitude of wanting everything your way may reach new extremes today. If you are involved in a one-on-one relationship, you need to watch that you are not dictating all the terms of the relationship, allowing your partner little freedom of movement. Although you may think you can trust yourself, it is better to play it safe, and not even take the risk.", "trabajo": "Your skills as a diplomat will be put to the test today. Anger will spring up all around in the workplace and you will be called on to sort out the broken pieces. Trust that you can indeed bring peace to an extremely volatile situation."}, "aries": {"personal": "You have hidden talents that may be revealed to you today, aries. Perhaps collaboration with someone new has you doing things you never thought you could. Perhaps you discover a talent for writing, graphic design, or money management. You can't help but delight in this discovery, as it opens up a world of new possibilities. You don't need to take action now. Revel in your untapped potential.", "amor": "You could potentially have a great day, if you can remember to stop picking at and criticizing your loved one. You are both feeling a little emotionally distant. But your attitude won't help if you are hoping to make them see the error of their ways. You may need to ask yourself about the error of your own ways. Go on - be nice!", "trabajo": "Don't purposely pull the wool over someone else's eyes today in order to boost your favor with the boss. The truth of your actions will eventually surface and you will be in worse standing than ever. Stick with an honest, open, and sincere approach."}, "pisces": {"personal": "You're by nature a person who likes to look toward the future. Today is a very special day for you. You might wonder what the next few months hold, Scorpio. You're trying to answer this question by looking within and coming up with insights about you and your goals that you've been too busy to see before. These will work for you and guide you in the right direction.", "amor": "Today's aspect at play makes you very much aware of what you have been feeling on a much subtler level for some time. A career move or perhaps a business lunch may yield far more than a new offer or deal. You could get well get more than you bargained for when someone seems irresistibly attractive to you. The stage has been setnow the drama will run.", "trabajo": "The only way you will be successful today is if you demonstrate that you can meet other people's expectations. Assert yourself more than usual. Don't sit back and wait for the perfect career opportunity to come to you. You need to move towards it."}}
