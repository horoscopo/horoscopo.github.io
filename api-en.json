{"libra": {"personal": "As much as you try to explain things, Leo, others simply aren't going to see them with your same intensity and do-or-die urgency. Be careful that you don't contrive a series of far-out stories that only partially reflect the truth. Make sure the picture you paint is accurate or else others may lose faith in your judgment.", "amor": "Love and romance are more fiery and passionate with today's celestial configuration. You will find it easier to express your feelings than you have of late. Whether you do so verbally, or by purchasing a wonderful gift for your sweetheart, you will feel just as good about giving this compliment as they will about receiving it. In fact, any way you can enhance your relationship will be beneficial.", "trabajo": "There is a good balance of old and new ideas filtering through your head today, making it easier for you to make an educated decision on your next major career move. Don't be afraid to embrace a new idea while paying attention to older traditions."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "If a problem comes your way today, Sagittarius, look for the simplest solution. Not every problem is complicated. Often the most obvious answer is the best one. Try to keep your emotions out of problems that require calculation and thought. They can obscure the view and keep you from seeing what's right in front of you. Draw strength from your common sense. Rule things out by process of elimination.", "amor": "The celestial atmosphere brings the realization that if you want to have a warm and wonderful relationship with someone, then you need to put some heat into your interactions. You tend to be very practical and also intellectual, and for you, sometimes love can be more a matter of whether the relationship serves a purpose, rather than how deeply you feel for someone.", "trabajo": "Lately, you have been doing a great deal of restructuring, and this has been a wonderful thing. At times it may be painful, but overall, it is for the best. You have been tearing down the old. Now is the time to start building the new."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You might be thrown off balance by the flightiness of today, cancer. Perhaps it's difficult to make a decision about anything. Try not to get too caught up in the gossip swarming around you. People may talk quite a bit today, but what you should be concerned with is substance. You want results and action, not empty information and promises.", "amor": "If you are going out on a first date this evening, today's aspect could mean that the pair of you may become quite passionate. This may not be in the romantic sense, but more in terms of the topics of conversation that you choose to talk about. Don't let your individual opinions and biases spoil what could possibly be a really warm and potentially loving relationship.", "trabajo": "This will be a busy day for you, but that is fine. You will use the energy given to you to accomplish a great deal - in many different areas. Tackle many small, short errands. Knock them off your list one by one. You will be quite efficient."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "This is a great day for you, scorpio. There's a terrific feeling of expansion in the air. This is one of those times in which a small germ of an idea can grow into something big right before your eyes. Projects are moving quickly, and information is being rapidly dispersed. Catch the energy and set your dreams in motion. You can accomplish a great deal if you try.", "amor": "Even you, the most solid and dependable person in the zodiac, occasionally have your off days. Today's planetary configuration indicates that you have the chance to change something that has needed some attention. If this concerns your partner, then you have to be careful how you tread.

How you say what you have to say is vital.", "trabajo": "There is a powerful movement in your workplace today and if you don't get on the bandwagon, you may be left behind. Don't scoff at the idea just because you would rather stick to what is familiar and comfortable. Risks taken today will pay off."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Do you have the uncomfortable feeling that there's something you ought to be doing but can't think what it is?

You may not recall it right now, but it will probably come to you later.", "amor": "The celestial energy offers you the chance to create a wonderful atmosphere in your own home, and to invite a few people around for a meal or impromptu party.

It is very possible that they will want to see you again!", "trabajo": "Your ideas are very timely; so don't hesitate to get them out to others as soon as possible.

Progress is made."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Turn your energy inward today, taurus. Make a detailed list of what you need to get done in order of priority. It's time to take inventory and get organized. Detail-oriented projects are favored, and      you have much more patience and concentration than usual. Slow down the pace and remember to smell the roses as you pass by.", "amor": "If you enjoy risk and challenge, then you will certainly appreciate today's astral configuration. But if you would rather stick to the tried and trusted, and keep within the parameters of your own certain but limited experience, then you can do this, too. When you see just what the cosmos has in store for you, you may no longer desire the status quo. Someone special comes your way!\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "This is a terrific day for you on many levels. The most significant is the fact that you begin a new four-week phase.

However, virgo, other responsibilities could keep you from starting on them. At the same time, your mind could be so focused on them that your other work takes longer than it should. Write down your ideas before they escape, then concentrate on the tasks at hand. Finish those and then you can pursue what you really want.", "amor": "You may have your romantic sights set on your boss, or some other figure of authority. Although you could also be worried about the possibility that they might not see you in the same light, you may just have to find some way of verifying your intuition. If they do, then this could be the start of something very promising.", "trabajo": "Use your imagination. The more creative you are, the better. Your ideas may seem rather unorthodox, but this doesn't mean that they hold no merit. Your innovative approach to an old problem is likely to propel you miles ahead of the competition."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "A debate over a controversial subject involving politics or social issues could take place today, capricorn.

Too much work and socializing might have you feeling less than your usual self, and perhaps even a little feverish and headachy. If so, this is a good day to take time out, stay home, and rest.

Take a break and your body will reward you with greater clarity and concentration.", "amor": "You won't get very far without some sense of humor today, especially with the current astral alignment.

The incident is not actually that important, so don't allow it to affect you. Life is far too short.", "trabajo": "You will get into a power struggle with someone today that may be quite difficult to resolve.
