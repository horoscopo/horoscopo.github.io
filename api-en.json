{"libra": {"personal": "Your creative nature is at a peak today, libra, and the artist within you is tempted to come out and play. Indulge in a fantasy world that makes you happiest. Escapism may be a necessary element to the day in order to balance all the hard work you've been doing. Express yourself creatively through whatever means available.", "amor": "Today could bring a sudden rupture in a certain relationship, yet some surprising developments in another. It may be difficult to come to terms with this break, but it ultimately has a positive outlook, as it may have occurred because the relationship was becoming too stifling and restrictive. Once the need for freedom is established, perhaps there can be some positive talking."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Your tasks should go smoothly and quickly today, particularly paperwork. Others are willing to lend a hand if you need it, and you might be called upon to assist another with a task beyond his or her ability. The atmosphere is unusually pleasant, so the day could just fly by. In the evening, go to a bookstore that's holding a lecture or book signing.", "amor": "You may enjoy a spell of pure popularity today. Your traditional approach to love and romance is greatly appreciated by one person, of whom you have had certain thoughts for some time. They adore your practical approach to relationships, where both parties help each other up the ladder of success by pooling resources and talents. You have a true admirer on your side."}, "cancer": {"personal": "You may not necessarily approve of the behavior of the people around you, Leo, but that doesn't mean you need to make their lives miserable. Be more accepting of others. Don't feel like you need to teach people a lesson simply because you don't understand their ways of life. You may be jumping to conclusions without taking the time to understand the situation.", "amor": "In the scary world of romance and dating, there are so many uncertainties to be encountered. Today you have every chance of one particularly scary encounter working to your advantage. Because you feel bold and confidently in charge, you inspire a sense of trust. Your newfound friend immediately adores you, and you wonder why you were ever worried."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "Your ESP continues to expand, scorpio, and you sense what friends are feeling without their saying anything. Don't be surprised if one is hiding some repressed anger! The chance to travel may come up unexpectedly, and you could be in a quandary about going. Consider it carefully. If it's feasible, go for it. This isn't the time to hold back.", "amor": "You may find that one conversation in particular leads to a romantic liaison that is very promising. The astral energy may bring about the chance to talk in more depth with someone whom you sense you would really get on with very well. It may be rather unusual in its subject matter, but you will realize that you are on the same wavelength."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "You're apt to move in and out of sync with people today, Capricorn. At first it may seem quite natural and easy to be in your situation, then the next minute you feel alone and uncomfortable. Understand that it's fine to have two conflicting feelings at the same time. Learn to relate to and embrace both frames of mind. Recognize them as important parts of your personality.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "Today's planetary energy may prove quite enlightening as you discover something that you didn't know. It may transpire that someone you have been secretly fond of is equally as fond of you, but may have been hiding their feelings for reasons that possibly do not make much sense. Although this may come as quite a shock, it is actually a pleasant one - for once."}, "taurus": {"personal": "You feel reprimanded because of the way you reacted to a situation that came out differently than you'd hoped. Trust that you acted in the best, calmest, and most understanding way possible. If the person you're dealing with doesn't understand your actions, then this is probably more a function of their own baggage and not yours.", "amor": "As if you didn't already have enough on your plate, you have a conflict of interests, as well. You should focus on a certain important relationship, and on resolving certain issues so there is a sense of harmony. This means you can give more to your budding career. If you can combine both, you will have a great day and a truly wonderful evening."}, "leo": {"personal": "Take a break from the seriousness that has prevailed over the past couple days, leo. Upbeat conversations are the way to navigate through today's waters. You might notice that others are more actively communicating and that words are especially effective. You talk and people listen. Do your share of listening, too. The conscious exchange of ideas is critical on a day like this.", "amor": "Today it is time to have a constructive conversation. Have that talk that you've been meaning to for some while. Although you may have put off the subject time and time again, if you can overcome that initial wave of fear, you will gradually gain confidence, and things can only get better. If you want to enjoy each other's company, then let the process of true understanding begin."}, "virgo": {"personal": "A check you may have been expecting in the mail may be delayed, virgo, and you might not be able to contact whoever is sending it. You could worry over whether or not you will get it at all. This could be a classic case of getting worked up over nothing. The delay won't cause any lasting problems, just inconvenience and frustration. Hang in there. The money will come.", "amor": "Although perhaps it is passion of a different kind, today's astral energy means that you will have quite a lot to give in the romance department. There is a more earthy quality that translates your fantasies into reality. It is the fantasies that could bridge the gap and start the healing which needs to take place physically. Have a great day; your partner definitely will!"}, "capricorn": {"personal": "You're likely to be very aware of things going on around you today, and you may internalize the opinions of others, Gemini. Be careful about opening yourself up so much that you get hurt by someone's offhand, unflattering comment. You will find the most comfort in tangible and stable things. Enjoy the material pleasures in life.\n \n \n \n ", "amor": "There is a light and easy atmosphere around, with today's planetary energy. So if you are going out on a date, you can expect it to be a very pleasant occasion, with a lot of interesting information being exchanged. If you are just beginning a new relationship, then it is a good time to continue finding out more about each other - and really enjoying the process."}, "gemini": {"personal": "Have you recently purchased something you wanted that's more of a luxury than a necessity? Today you might feel guilty about it. It may have temporarily strained your budget. Don't even think about taking it back! Sometimes luxury items can lift the spirits. Payday will be around again before you know it.", "amor": "The current astral energy may encourage you, the epitome of responsibility, to do something quite silly with regards to your romantic life. If you don't mind making a potential fool of yourself, then read no further. If you would prefer to keep your sense of decorum, then don't give in to blind impulses - make sure you think first. Otherwise it could take some time to regain your credibility."}, "aries": {"personal": "As career and money matters continue to advance, your self-confidence is high and your mind is very positive. You should continue to attract good fortune. Expect more pleasant surprises and sudden breaks this month, aries. You'll attract new friendships based on shared spiritual values, and old friendships should solidify even more. Life is treating you well.", "amor": "Don't worry if things don't go according to plan today, as the current astral configuration is creating a very interesting cosmic climate right now. If you are looking for someone very special, then you won't connect with them in any of your usual haunts. You need to range far and wide, and go places that are quite different from the ones you usually frequent - but you won't be disappointed."}, "pisces": {"personal": "It's time to settle down from the rapid-fire activities of the past few days and retreat to a quieter state of mind, pisces. Take care of the details you failed to attend to while you were out having fun. Now is the time to turn inward and reflect. Rely on your inner reserves as opposed to your outwardly directed actions. Stay grounded and let your emotions work with your rational side.", "amor": "You may find that you have a few surprises in store romantically. The day may begin well enough, but could suddenly turn into a wild extravaganza of unknown proportions. You could meet up with someone who shares the same freaky hobbies as you, and who also has very strange, endearing, and uncomplicated ways of being themselves. If it feels right, go for it."}}
