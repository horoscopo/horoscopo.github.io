{"libra": {"personal": "Do you need a change of pace, Gemini? If things are beginning to feel boring and you're apathetic, chances are that you do. All you have to do is figure out what to shift. If you're home most of the time, change the furniture around. It can make the house seem new. Consider putting up new pictures or bringing in fresh flowers. Switch your schedule around. This will energize you.", "amor": "If you are looking for love, which is not often the case with your sign, you would do well to be able to listen to what others have to say. If you are at a social gathering, rather than trying to impress others with your string of glittering achievements, allow others to do most of the talking.", "trabajo": "The day will start out rather sluggish and even a bit frustrating, but don't worry. Toward the afternoon, the pace will pick up and you will be much more in tune with those around you, giving you a wonderful jump-start to the workweek ahead."}, "sagittarius": {"personal": "Today you'll feel inspired to express yourself in fun, creative ways. Don't be afraid to let loose with your wild sense of humor. You could play a prank on a friend that makes him or her laugh and creates good feelings. Or you could share some jokes with others that make them smile and feel better. You enjoy playing the clown, and you're good at it!", "amor": "You are usually adept at handling the niceties of relationships, and of smoothing over any rough patches with a host of well-meant platitudes. But the energy of the day may bring to your attention the need to be more honest about your feelings for your loved one. People can see when you are not being truly sincere, and will feel that they are being short-changed in some way.", "trabajo": "You will find that you are very easily distracted today. It seems that everyone else's business is more important than yours. Gossip around your workplace will be running wild. Try not to add your own judgmental comments to the frenzy. Stay grounded."}, "cancer": {"personal": "As you work to keep things in balance today, Cancer, remember that one of the key things is to have fun. Happiness is an extremely important element of the cosmic equation, especially on a day like this. The more upbeat you can be regarding a certain situation, the easier it will be to tackle it. A smile can get you through just about any door you wish to enter.", "amor": "Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a relationship, they take, effort and a strong sense of commitment. The current planetary alignment indicates that if your thoughts have been straying away from your current partner and dwelling on someone else, you may need to reflect on why this is happening. The answer lies in facing what you are really feeling and then talking about it. Be fearless!", "trabajo": "Your life may sometimes feel like a giant roller coaster ride, yet you are always smiling. Today you are at a peak, so enjoy the high point you are at and use it to your advantage. Just remember that not everyone is sharing your good mood."}, "scorpio": {"personal": "You tend to be unconventional, but today you could outdo even you. A spiritual experience could be at the heart of it. You're changing in ways that are obvious to everyone. Don't worry if they're confused. You'll be confused, too. Think of yourself as a caterpillar becoming a butterfly! The transition may be strange, but the butterfly is far lovelier than the caterpillar!", "amor": "Today reveals there is little point in pretending to be the life and soul of the party or the jolliest person in the room if you don't feel this way. If your partner comments on the lack of terminal jokes you have told so far today, you may have to admit that even you, \"the last laugh of the universe,\" have your quiet and grumpy days.", "trabajo": "You are feeling much more stable than usual. Be confident. You certainly have every reason to be. You have done a great deal of work and it has earned you a great deal of respect. Now is the time to cash in. Be proud of what you have accomplished."}, "aquarius": {"personal": "Purchases for your home might be one of your projects today. Your aesthetic sense is very high right now and your good taste at a peak. You're likely to be more attracted to the unusual and unconventional than usual. Unexpected but welcome visitors could come to your door, and some fascinating conversations could result. You might even host an impromptu event.", "amor": "Today's astral energy may encourage you to talk about your feelings, but you will need to pay attention to the way that you express them. If you are not careful, your proclamations of love could come out sounding too intellectual and wordy, with not enough real feeling involved. It may be better to give a gift that speaks volumes more eloquently than you can today.", "trabajo": "This morning is like a \"last hurrah\" for you in many ways. Use this time to your advantage because once the afternoon sinks in, other people may turn a deaf ear to your new and innovative ideas. Capture people's attention early, instead of waiting."}, "taurus": {"personal": "Unusual dreams, visions, and audio phenomena may come to you today. You might think you're hearing voices. Before jumping to conclusions, rule out any logical conditions. You're not crazy. This probably indicates a growing psychic awareness. You should write down what you see, hear, or learn during this time. It could be valuable.", "amor": "This is a great time to try a more experimental approach to your love life. The current planetary position indicates that if you have been working with the traditional way of dating, and have discovered this to be sadly lacking, you will need to come up with something completely new and untested. The more original, radical, and enthusiastic you are about your plan, the better chance it has of succeeding.\n \n \n \n ", "trabajo": "You are a pioneer and an inventor. Tune into this part of your personality as you go about your day. Ask yourself what needs to be created in order to make your job go more smoothly and efficiently and then make plans to create this very thing."}, "leo": {"personal": "You would do well to join the intensity of the day, Aries. You have the ability to unravel any riddle and find the underlying cause of any dispute. There's a great deal of potential for you to follow through on some major projects today. Work to press through with your ideas. Don't back down. Your sensitivity is your greatest asset. Feel free to express your emotions.", "amor": "Although there is the potential for passion in the air with today's planetary energies, it will tend to be low key, even if very intense. You and your loved one may not have been seeing each other for very long, but you both know that you are serious about this relationship. There is a certain depth between you that neither of you have ever felt before.", "trabajo": "You will be juggling phone calls, e-mails, paperwork, family, your boss, your co-worker's marital problems, laundry, and 1000 other things. The amazing thing is that you will do it all with incredible grace and confidence. Pat yourself on the back."}, "virgo": {"personal": "This is a passionate, creative day, Taurus. Your blood is hot and passion is on your mind. With luck, you have a significant other who can benefit! If not, you will have to find another way to burn off that energy. Invite a close friend for a jog. You're in the mood to socialize. If you can't have physical intimacy, be satisfied with emotional closeness.", "amor": "The energy of the day is making your lover a little selfish, even though they don't intend to be mean or hold back. But perhaps there is a lesson in this for you, as well. You are often so worried about upsetting the apple cart that you will go with other's wishes to keep the peace. Perhaps it is time you spoke up for yourself, as well.", "trabajo": "Make sure to get some physical exercise. Being outside in the fresh air will be an extremely beneficial thing. At the very least, take a short walk around the block. It is best that you stretch your legs and get your body moving at this time."}, "capricorn": {"personal": "Your words have tremendous impact today, so think before you speak. It's easy to hurt others' feelings if you don't take them into account. Try to be careful in any phone conversation and always verify that you've made yourself clear, especially when giving directions. Go deeper today instead of just floating about on the surface. People will open up to you.", "amor": "You will most likely find today quite stimulating in more ways than one. There's a feeling in the air of victory, or at least a potential victory. Someone you have been trying to get know finally has the courage to tell you how they feel about you. This is a surprise, as only a while ago they wouldn't even look you in the eye!", "trabajo": "Don't let a special opportunity pass you by. Someone will say something casually in passing that may spark your interest. Don't let this inspiration die. Jot down this idea, phone number, or contact name. This is the big one you've been waiting for."}, "gemini": {"personal": "People of great power and drive may pop out of the woodwork today. They'll confront you directly and perhaps challenge you in some way. You may be at a climactic point right now, and feel like you're at a junction. Make adjustments now. Realize that change is a key ingredient for growth. Upheaval and action may be necessary.", "amor": "You will perhaps find today a little dry for your taste. The celestial energy means that you have every chance of spending the day in deep conversation, rather than enjoying the finer and subtler qualities of feeling and the delicacies of love. The most you can hope for is to try and persuade your loved one to take you to a romantic movie on the grounds that you can review it - second hand is better than nothing at all.", "trabajo": "There is a great deal of nervous energy surrounding you. You are feeling pressure from all sides to act or perform a certain way. Whether you like it or not, you will be caught in a difficult battle. Be patient with others and try not to overreact."}, "aries": {"personal": "You may feel a nervous restlessness today that's urging you to get moving, aries. A journey to one place may send you off to another, which may take you on an adventure to some completely different place. It may seem like you're on a crazy scavenger hunt. The energy of the day could leave you feeling ragged, but don't give up. Your persistence will pay off in the end.", "amor": "You may turn a lot of heads and cause a lot of eyebrows to be raised today. This is a time when you can really use your love of beauty and image to the max. However, even though you may cause pulses to race, don't expect everyone to play the game the way you like it to be played. Just be aware of this fact.", "trabajo": "Electronic devices and mechanical gadgets that you have purchased for the workplace will make things more confusing instead of easier for you over the next few weeks. Be patient. Revisit manuals at this time, even if it is your day off from work."}, "pisces": {"personal": "Debilitating indecision may plague you. You've been coasting along letting your good luck see you through to prosperity. It's like you're tied to a rope and constantly testing its limits. Unfortunately, you could hit a snag and feel you can go no further. Emotional issues suggest that you didn't take your feelings into account. It's time to reevaluate your approach.", "amor": "Excitement, unpredictability, uncertainty are all words that spring to mind concerning today's planetary energy. You may not know where a certain relationship is going, but whilst you're getting there, you won't be bored. Between the walls of the office environment and at home, you begin a conversation that has no appearance of ending in any sort of hurryand could indeed continue for quite some time.", "trabajo": "Communication with others in the workplace will be especially strong during the next two weeks. Major progress is made as a result. You are able to make huge strides in your yearly goals as long as you use this productive time wisely and efficiently."}}
